Homer interviews potential secretaries. Each candidate fails to impress for various reasons.

Then Karl walks in. He's confident, professional, and immediately perceptive about Homer's insecurities.

**Karl:** "You told me with the way you slump your shoulders, the way you talk into your chest, the way you smother yourself in bargain-basement lime-green polyester."

Karl sees through Homer's surface and recognizes his potential. He tells Homer to look in the mirror and say: "I deserve this. I am the finest creature God ever created."

Homer hires Karl on the spot.

**Notable First:** First and only appearance of Karl (Harvey Fierstein).

**Karl:** "My reasons... are my own."

Smithers has no choice but to fire Karl instead of Homer. Karl is terminated.

#### Scene 14: Karl's Farewell
**Location:** Springfield Nuclear Power Plant - Hallway
**Characters:** Homer, Karl

Homer is devastated to see Karl go. Karl reassures Homer that he has everything he needs to succeed - the confidence came from within, not from the hair.

In a tender moment, Karl kisses Homer on the lips - a groundbreaking moment for 1990 television.

**Karl:** Tells Homer his success was never about the hair.

Karl leaves, and Homer must face the executive world alone.

**Production Note:** This same-sex kiss aired a full decade before Dawson's Creek's widely publicized man-on-man kiss.

#### Scene 15: Simpson Home - The Disaster
**Location:** 742 Evergreen Terrace - Bathroom
**Characters:** Homer, Bart

That night, Homer catches Bart in the bathroom using his Dimoxinil, trying to grow a beard.

#### Scene 16: Simpson Home - Hair Loss
**Location:** 742 Evergreen Terrace - Bedroom
**Characters:** Homer, Marge

The next morning, Homer wakes up completely bald again. Without the daily Dimoxinil application, his hair has fallen out overnight.

#### Scene 17: Springfield Nuclear Power Plant - The Presentation
**Location:** Mr. Burns' Office
**Characters:** Homer, Mr. Burns, Smithers, executives

Homer enters to give his presentation, bald and defeated. Mr. Burns and the executives react with shock and disappointment.

Without his hair - and without Karl's support - Homer stumbles through his presentation. It's a disaster.

Mr. Burns, however, shows an unexpected moment of sympathy. He too suffers from male-pattern baldness. He understands Homer's pain.

Rather than firing Homer outright, Burns demotes him back to his original position as safety inspector.

#### Scene 18: Simpson Home - Marge's Love
**Location:** 742 Evergreen Terrace - Bedroom
**Characters:** Homer, Marge

Homer lies in bed, depressed about losing everything - his hair, his promotion, his confidence.

Marge consoles him. She gently sings "You Are So Beautiful" to Homer, affirming that she loves him regardless of his appearance.

Homer realizes that Marge's love is unconditional. He may have lost his hair and his promotion, but he still has what matters most - his family.
