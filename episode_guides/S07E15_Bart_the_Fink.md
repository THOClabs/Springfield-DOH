## Synopsis

When Great-Aunt Hortense passes away, the Simpson children each inherit $100. While Lisa plans to donate her money to public television, Bart schemes to spend his on frivolous items. Marge insists both children open savings accounts at the Springfield Savings Bank, despite the unappealing "Kidz' First! Bank Acount" promotional event featuring employees in ape costumes.

With his new checkbook in hand, Bart devises a clever scheme to obtain Krusty the Clown's autograph for free: he writes Krusty a check for 25 cents, expecting that when Krusty endorses the check, Bart will have an authentic autograph. However, when the cancelled check returns, instead of Krusty's signature, it bears the stamp of an offshore Cayman Islands holding corporation.

A nosy bank teller reports the suspicious account activity, triggering a chain reaction of phone calls that culminates in Krusty being arrested for massive tax evasion—or as Kent Brockman insists on calling it, "tax avoision." The IRS garnishes Krusty's salary and auctions off all his possessions, including his mansion and burger restaurant chain. His show is reduced to a low-budget production.

Devastated and humiliated, Krusty apparently crashes his plane into a mountainside in what appears to be suicide. Springfield holds a memorial service, and Bart is wracked with guilt for causing his hero's downfall. However, while exploring near the waterfront, Bart and Lisa discover that Krusty faked his death and is now living as "Rory B. Bellows," a salvage boat operator. The children eventually convince Krusty to return to show business, and he resolves his tax problems through insurance fraud—collecting on his own "death" by scuttling the salvage boat.
