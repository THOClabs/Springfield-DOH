## Synopsis

When Marge is expelled from the Springfield Investorettes for being too cautious about high-risk investments, she receives her $500 contribution back and Lisa encourages her to use it to buy a business franchise. At a Franchise Expo, the Investorettes join the successful "Fleet-A-Pita" franchise while Marge reluctantly chooses the smaller, less promising "Pretzel Wagon," owned by the earnest but doomed Frank Ormand. Marge's pretzel business struggles from the start—her initial customers at the nuclear plant are stolen by the Fleet-A-Pita van, and a "Free Pretzel Day" at the Springfield Isotopes game ends in disaster when fans riot after Mr. Burns wins a car giveaway, pelting the field (and Whitey Ford) with pretzels. Seeing Marge depressed, Homer secretly enlists Fat Tony and the Springfield Mafia to help her business. The mob intimidates all competing food vendors, culminating in the explosion of the Investorettes' Fleet-A-Pita van. When Homer refuses to pay for the favor, Fat Tony demands 100% of Marge's profits. The episode climaxes with an epic showdown on the Simpson lawn between Fat Tony's mafia and the Yakuza (hired by the vengeful Investorettes), as the Simpson family watches safely from inside.
