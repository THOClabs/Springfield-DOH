## Synopsis

After nearly drowning in his bathtub, Mr. Burns realizes his mortality and decides he needs an heir to inherit his vast fortune and the Springfield Nuclear Power Plant. He holds auditions for young boys to become his heir, rejecting candidates via a butt-kicking machine. When Bart's audition fails miserably (due to Homer's poorly written script), he angrily vandalizes Burns' mansion. Burns witnesses the destruction and is impressed by the "creature of pure malevolence," choosing Bart as his heir. Bart moves into Burns Manor, enjoying unlimited wealth and freedom. However, when the Simpson family tries to get Bart back, Burns manipulates him with a fake video showing actors pretending to be his family saying they hate him. When Burns ultimately demands that Bart fire Homer, Bart refuses and drops Burns down a trapdoor, choosing his real family over wealth. He returns home, where Homer has mistakenly adopted a deprogrammed Hans Moleman who believes he's Bart.
