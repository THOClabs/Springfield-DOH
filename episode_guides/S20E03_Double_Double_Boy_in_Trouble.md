## PLOT SUMMARY

### Act One: The Lottery Ticket

At the Kwik-E-Mart, Homer rushes to purchase the last lottery ticket, but becomes distracted when Bart starts dancing on the shelves before attempting a cannonball onto the floor. While Homer tries to save Bart from injury, Lenny swoops in and buys the lottery ticket, winning $50,000.

A gleeful Lenny invites a sullen Homer and his family to a rich, posh party at the expensive Woosterfield Hotel. However, before the party, Bart unintentionally sprays Marge's new dress with cat urine (which was originally meant for Rod and Todd Flanders), angering both Marge and Homer.

At the party, while Homer tells Lenny he is grateful for his friend's success, Bart concocts a plan to destroy the celebration. He opens all the gift bags and releases the Vac-U-Bots, which run wild and cause mayhem, destroying everything.

### Act Two: The Switch

The police catch Bart, and a furious Marge confiscates all of his prized possessions. An angry Bart heads to the bathroom, where he meets Simon Woosterfield, a rich boy who turns out to be Bart's exact look-alike. Upon first meeting, Bart says "You look like a dorky version of me!" to which Simon replies: "And you look like a dimwitted version of me!"

Bart learns that Simon dislikes his rich and pompous lifestyle. In order to satisfy them both, the two boys decide to switch places.

Bart arrives at the lavish Woosterfield mansion and is delighted to find football great Joe Montana hanging around the estate. He meets his new "family," including Devan and Quenley, his supposed half-brother and sister, who immediately begin smugly bullying him.

### Act Three: The Discovery

Meanwhile, Simon settles into the Simpson household and isn't used to their simple lifestyle. Lisa, the most inquisitive family member, begins to suspect that "Bart" isn't who he really is. When Simon uses the word "defenestrated" (meaning to throw out a window), Lisa realizes the truth, exclaiming "The real Bart would've thrown me out the window!" Simon's sophisticated vocabulary betrays him further when he asks, "You mean I'm just digging myself even deeper?"

Despite his initial complaints, Simon begins to enjoy Marge's loving attention when she tucks him in at night, something he's never experienced in his wealthy but emotionally distant family.

### Act Four: The Inheritance Plot

At a magnificent party hosted by the Woosterfields for the rich elite, Bart meets Mr. Burns and Smithers. Curious about why Devan and Quenley constantly bully him, Bart asks Burns for insight. Mr. Burns shares a story about his childhood growing up as the youngest of a large wealthy family, explaining that since his other siblings died, he inherited all the family money.

Bart realizes with horror that Devan and Quenley may be plotting to kill him (thinking he's Simon) in order to inherit the entire Woosterfield fortune. He becomes furious when he realizes Simon has set him up.

### Act Five: The Rescue

Lisa finally confronts the imposter and figures out that Simon is not Bart. She tries to determine what the two boys are up to. Simon admits to the entire Simpson family that the real Bart is in grave danger - Devan and Quenley have taken him on a ski trip to Aspen, hoping to kill him there.

Before the Simpsons can reach him, Quenley pushes Bart down a treacherous hill designed for experienced skiers. In a shocking twist, when Devan suggests they split Simon's inheritance, Quenley offers Devan a poisoned baked potato, planning to claim the entire fortune for herself.

Homer manages to save Bart by jumping off a ski lift in a heroic (if clumsy) rescue attempt, declaring "This looks like a job for CAPTAIN CRAZY! Up, up and away!" As he plummets like a stone, he laments, "Oh, come on, gravity. You used to be cool."

The Simpson family says goodbye to Simon, who is welcomed back to his own family with newfound appreciation. Newly grateful for his own loving (if chaotic) family, Bart is tucked into bed by Marge, content to be home.

- "It was a far from groundbreaking episode, to be sure, but our familiarity of the characters and the fair amount of laughs made for yet another pleasurable viewing experience."
- "The story as a whole was interesting and the jokes were funny enough to elicit several audible guffaws."

**Steve Heisler (The A.V. Club) - Grade: C**
- Criticized it as "a boring, flat, contrived episode" with an "uninteresting Bart"

## CONCLUSION

"Double, Double, Boy in Trouble" serves as a classic "identity swap" episode that allows The Simpsons to explore class differences, family dynamics, and the age-old question of whether money can buy happiness. While not considered one of the series' strongest episodes, it provides solid entertainment through its familiar character dynamics, dark comedy elements (particularly the murder plot), and ultimately heartwarming message about appreciating one's family.

The episode successfully balances humor with genuine character moments, particularly in Simon's growing appreciation for Marge's maternal warmth and Bart's realization that his chaotic family, despite their flaws, truly cares for him. The addition of celebrity guest Joe Montana and numerous pop culture references keeps the episode grounded in The Simpsons' tradition of satirizing American culture and celebrity.
