## Synopsis

Santa's Little Helper's destructive behavior reaches a breaking point when he destroys a six-generation family quilt, Homer's expensive new "Assassin" sneakers, and a giant cookie. Homer announces that unless the dog passes obedience school, he'll be given away. Bart enrolls Santa's Little Helper in Emily Winthrop's Canine College, but the dog fails to respond to training - especially since Bart refuses to use a choke chain. The night before the final exam, with their future together at stake, Bart and Santa's Little Helper bond through play, finally breaking through the communication barrier. The dog passes the test at the last moment, and Lisa commemorates the occasion by starting a new family quilt.

**Emily Winthrop:** A stern British woman who runs the school with military precision. Her mannerisms parody Margaret Thatcher, though she's actually based on real British dog trainer Barbara Woodhouse.

**Notable Detail:** Tracey Ullman voices Emily Winthrop. This is significant because The Simpsons started as shorts on The Tracey Ullman Show. Matt Groening had wanted Ullman to guest star earlier but was told she was too busy. When her show was cancelled in 1990, she agreed to appear.

Emily Winthrop is a firm believer in the choke chain as a training tool.

While other dogs in the class make progress with their owners, Santa's Little Helper fails every drill.

He won't sit, stay, heel, or follow any commands.

Emily Winthrop grows increasingly frustrated with the pair.

#### Scene 11: Dog's Eye View
**Location:** Various
**Characters:** Santa's Little Helper

The episode shows scenes from Santa's Little Helper's point of view.

**Characters:** Bart, Emily Winthrop, Santa's Little Helper

Week after week, Santa's Little Helper fails to improve.

Emily Winthrop warns Bart that the dog is not making progress.

**Characters:** Bart, Santa's Little Helper

The night before the final test, Bart believes this might be his last night with Santa's Little Helper.

Rather than drilling commands, Bart decides to just play with his dog.

They run around, play fetch, and enjoy each other's company without pressure.

**The Breakthrough:** Through the joy of play, something clicks. Santa's Little Helper starts responding to Bart's commands.

Not through force or choke chains, but through the bond of friendship and understanding.

Bart realizes the dog CAN learn - he just needed love, not discipline.

**Characters:** Bart, Santa's Little Helper, Emily Winthrop, Homer, Other Students

Sit. Stay. Heel. He passes.

**Emily Winthrop:** "You son of a bitch... Good show!"

Her comment sounds contemptuous at first, then turns warm and approving.

#### Scene 16: Homer's Reaction
**Location:** Emily Winthrop's Canine College
**Characters:** Homer, Bart, Santa's Little Helper

Homer witnesses Santa's Little Helper passing the test.

Despite wanting to get rid of the dog, he's stuck with him now.

Homer reluctantly accepts that the dog can stay.

#### Scene 17: The New Quilt
**Location:** 742 Evergreen Terrace
**Characters:** Lisa, Marge, Family

Lisa has recovered from the mumps.

She presents her new project: the beginning of a new family quilt.

**The First Panel:** Depicts the destruction of the old quilt - Santa's Little Helper's rampage is now part of family history.
