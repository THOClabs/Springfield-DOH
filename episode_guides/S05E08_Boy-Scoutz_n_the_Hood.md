## Synopsis

After finding $20 on the ground, Bart and Milhouse purchase an all-syrup Squishee at the Kwik-E-Mart, triggering a wild sugar-fueled bender through Springfield. Bart wakes the next morning with no memory, only to discover he's somehow joined the Junior Campers - a Boy Scout-style organization led by scoutmaster Ned Flanders. Initially embarrassed, Bart grows to enjoy the activities, especially when he's promised a real pocket knife after completing knife safety training. The climax involves a father-son rafting trip where Homer, Bart, Ned, and Rod get hopelessly lost at sea after Homer uses the map for kindling. Homer ultimately saves them by smelling his way to a Krusty Burger oil rig. Meanwhile, celebrity dad Ernest Borgnine leads another group of scouts into a swamp where they encounter a terrifying unseen threat.
