## Synopsis

When a series of unfortunate coincidences leads child welfare authorities to deem Homer and Marge unfit parents, their three children are taken away and placed in foster care with the Flanders family. Bart contracts head lice at school and Lisa loses her shoes to bullies, both occurring on the same day that Marge and Homer leave the kids with Grampa to enjoy a spa day. When Child Protective Services arrives at the Simpson home, they find Grampa unconscious, the house in disarray, and the children showing signs of neglect. Bart, Lisa, and Maggie are removed from the home and placed with Ned and Maude Flanders next door. While Homer and Marge are forced to attend a parenting skills course to regain custody, the children experience life under the Flanders' strict religious household. The crisis reaches its peak when Ned, believing he is saving their souls, attempts to baptize the children. Homer arrives just in time to interrupt the ceremony, accidentally getting baptized himself in the dramatic rescue.
