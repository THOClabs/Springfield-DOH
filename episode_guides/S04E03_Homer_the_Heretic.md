## Synopsis

On a bitterly cold Sunday morning, Homer decides to skip church and stay home. He has the best day of his life - dancing in his underwear, making his own waffle recipe, winning a radio contest, and finding a penny. When Marge confronts him about missing church, Homer announces he's quitting church entirely and starting his own religion. He has a dream where God appears and gives him permission to worship in his own way. However, when Homer falls asleep while smoking a cigar, his house catches fire. He's rescued by volunteer firefighters of different faiths - Ned Flanders (Christian), Krusty the Clown (Jewish), and Apu (Hindu) - leading Homer to reconsider his views on organized religion. He returns to church, though he falls asleep during the sermon.
