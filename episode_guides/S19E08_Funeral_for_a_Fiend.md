## Synopsis

After Marge dreams that Keith Olbermann chides her for fast-forwarding through commercials, she tries to make amends by watching hours of advertisements. The Simpson family becomes intrigued by a commercial for "Wes Doobner's World-Famous Family-Style Rib Huts" and drives to the restaurant, only to discover it's an elaborate trap set by Sideshow Bob. When Bob's murder attempt fails, he is put on trial where his father blames Bart for Bob's psychosis. During the proceedings, Bart accidentally kills Bob. Feeling guilty, Bart attends Bob's funeral and is convinced by Cecil to visit the funeral home to make peace. However, this is all an elaborate scheme - Bob faked his death using a drug administered by his father, and now traps Bart in a coffin to be cremated. Lisa and Milhouse deduce the plot (Bob intentionally misquoted Shakespeare to get caught, knowing his father would use the death-simulating drug). The Simpsons race to save Bart just in time, and the entire Terwilliger family is arrested. This marks Kelsey Grammer's tenth appearance as Sideshow Bob and reunites the Frasier cast as the Terwilliger family.

#### Scene 2: Marge's Penance
**Location:** Simpson Home
**Characters:** Simpson Family

Marge tries to make amends by watching hours and hours of commercials. Lisa has installed TiVo, and as Marge fast-forwards, we see commercials from previous Simpsons episodes, including the "Mr. Sparkle" commercial from Season 8 and the SpringShield ad from Season 13.

#### Scene 5: Bob's Failed Attempt

Bob is interrupted as authorities arrive and arrest him once again.

Sideshow Bob is put on trial for his attempted murder. His father, Dr. Robert Terwilliger Sr., takes the stand.

**Bart:** "What?! I'm not the one trying to kill people!"

The father's testimony shifts blame to Bart, creating sympathy for Bob.

**Characters:** Bart, Simpson Family

Bart feels tremendous guilt about causing Bob's death, even though Bob was trying to kill him.

**Bart:** "I killed him. I actually killed Sideshow Bob."

**Lisa:** "Bart, he was trying to murder us. You shouldn't feel bad."

**Bart:** "But now everyone wishes I was dead. I'm a killer!"

Bart remains unconvinced and continues to struggle with guilt.

#### Scene 10: The Funeral Invitation
**Location:** Simpson Home
**Characters:** Bart, Cecil Terwilliger

Cecil Terwilliger, Bob's brother, arrives at the Simpson home.

**Cecil:** "Bart, despite everything my brother did, I'd like to invite you to his funeral. To bury the hatchet, as they say."

**Bart:** "Really?"

**Cecil:** "Yes. Bob spoke of you often. I think he'd want you there to make peace."

Cecil's invitation plays on Bart's guilt perfectly.

Krusty the Clown sits at a piano and performs an emotional song.

**Krusty:** (singing) "Farewell, Sideshow Bob... you tried to kill me but... I'll miss you anyway..."

#### Scene 12: Cecil's Manipulation
**Location:** Funeral Home
**Characters:** Bart, Cecil Terwilliger

After the service, Cecil approaches Bart again.

**Cecil:** "Bart, would you like to make your peace with Bob before he's cremated? You could visit him privately."

**Bart:** "I don't know..."

**Cecil:** "It would give you closure. Help with the guilt you're feeling."

**Bart:** "Okay. I'll do it."

Cecil's plan is working perfectly.

#### Scene 13: The Coffin Trap
**Location:** Funeral Home - Crematorium Area
**Characters:** Bart, Sideshow Bob

Bart enters the room where Bob's coffin awaits cremation. He approaches nervously.

**Bart:** "Bob, it's me, Bart. I came here to tell you I never meant for you to die. I just wanted you to go to jail and get beat up a lot."

Suddenly, the coffin lid bursts open and Sideshow Bob springs up, very much alive!

**Sideshow Bob:** "Then let's give the people what they want!"

**Bart:** "You're alive?!"

**Bob:** "Indeed! And now, Bart Simpson, you will take my place in this coffin!"

Bob grabs Bart and forces him into the coffin, slamming the lid shut.

**Bart:** (pounding on coffin lid) "Let me out!"

#### Scene 14: Lisa's Deduction

Meanwhile, Lisa and Milhouse are discussing the situation.

**Milhouse:** "It's too bad about Sideshow Bob. I heard his mom was a famous Shakespearean actress."

**Lisa:** (sudden realization) "Wait... what did you say?"

**Milhouse:** "His mom? She's an actress?"

**Lisa:** "That's it! If Bob's mother was a Shakespearean actress, Bob would have known Shakespeare too well to make that mistake! He misquoted it on purpose!"

Lisa starts piecing together the elaborate plot.

**Lisa:** "He wanted to get caught at the trial! His father must have used some kind of drug to simulate death! Cecil played on Bart's guilt to lure him to the funeral home! It's all a trap!"

#### Scene 15: The Race to Save Bart
**Location:** Various / Funeral Home
**Characters:** Simpson Family, Sideshow Bob, Bart

Lisa alerts the family and they race to the funeral home.

**Lisa:** "We have to save Bart! The whole family is in on it!"

**Marge:** "Drive faster, Homer!"

At the funeral home, the cremation process is beginning. Bart is trapped in the coffin moving toward the flames.

**Bart:** (inside coffin) "Help! Somebody help me!"

**Bob:** "Farewell, Bart Simpson! Enjoy your fiery demise!"

Bart tries various escape attempts inside the coffin.

**Bob:** "Not remotely."

#### Scene 16: The Rescue
**Location:** Funeral Home - Crematorium
**Characters:** Simpson Family, Bart, Sideshow Bob, Terwilliger Family

The Simpsons burst in just as the coffin is about to enter the cremation chamber.

**Homer:** "Stop that cremation!"

Homer rushes forward, but Marge is faster.

**Marge:** "Bart!"

**Homer:** (blocking Marge) "Wait! He's got to get over his fear of coffins."

**Marge:** "Homer!"

**Lisa:** "There's no time!"

They manage to pull the coffin back and release Bart just in time.

**Bart:** (emerging, covered in ash) "I knew you'd come!"

**Sideshow Bob:** "You're too late, Simpsons! I... wait, you're actually right on time. Curse you!"

#### Scene 17: The Full Reveal
**Location:** Funeral Home
**Characters:** All

Lisa explains the entire plot.

**Lisa:** "Bob deliberately misquoted Shakespeare so he'd get caught and go to trial. His father used a special drug to make him appear dead, just like in Romeo and Juliet! His mother's acting experience helped Bob play dead convincingly. Cecil manipulated Bart's guilt to get him here. It was all planned!"

**Dr. Terwilliger Sr.:** "Confound it! How did you deduce our scheme?"

**Francesca Terwilliger:** (dramatically) "The girl is too clever!"

**Cecil:** "We were so close!"

**Sideshow Bob:** "Blast! Foiled again by the Simpson children!"

#### Scene 18: Arrest and Resolution
**Location:** Funeral Home
**Characters:** Terwilliger Family, Chief Wiggum, Police, Simpsons

Chief Wiggum and the police arrive to arrest the entire Terwilliger family.

**Chief Wiggum:** "Okay, you're all under arrest. The whole family."

**Sideshow Bob:** "This is outrageous! I demand—"

**Wiggum:** "Yeah, yeah. Tell it to the judge. Again."

The police lead the Terwilliger family away.

**Cecil:** (to Bob) "Well, brother, we gave it our best shot."

**Bob:** "Indeed we did, Cecil. Indeed we did."

**Dr. Terwilliger Sr.:** "I'm too old for prison!"

**Francesca Terwilliger:** (dramatically) "Parting is such sweet sorrow!"

#### Scene 19: The Cake
**Location:** Simpson Home
**Characters:** Simpson Family

Back home, the Simpsons celebrate Bart's rescue with a cake.

The cake reads: "Tenth fiendish plot foiled"

**Homer:** (eating cake) "Mmm... foiled plot cake."

**Bart:** "Wait, shouldn't it be the ninth? Cecil was responsible for one of those plots, not Bob."

**Lisa:** "You're right. Bob rescued us in 'Brother from Another Series.'"

**Bart:** "So technically, it should be the ninth fiendish plot foiled."

**Homer:** "Who cares? More cake!"

**Marge:** "Well, at least we're all safe now."

The family enjoys their cake as the episode ends.

## Reception

### Ratings
In its original broadcast on November 25, 2007, "Funeral for a Fiend" was watched by approximately **9.0 million viewers**. The episode benefited from airing the day after Thanksgiving when viewership was typically higher.

Season 19 overall ranked 83rd in the seasonal ratings with an average viewership of 7.950 million viewers and an 18-49 Nielsen Rating of 3.8, making it the highest-ranking show from "Animation Domination" that season, ranking above Family Guy.

### Critical Reception
Critical reception was **mixed to negative**, with many reviewers feeling the episode failed to live up to previous Sideshow Bob episodes:

**Robert Canning of IGN** gave the episode a **6.2/10**, saying "there were some enjoyable scenes, but the half hour lacked in the number of laugh-out-loud moments, and Bob's ultimate scheme wasn't very surprising."

**Richard Keller of AOL TV** said, "While Pierce and Mahoney did have their moments it was all Grammer this episode as a Sideshow Bob coming apart at the seams." He went on to say, "For the most part this week's episode was entertaining."

Multiple reviewers noted that **"Funeral For a Fiend" was mostly bland** compared to earlier Sideshow Bob episodes, which were often highlights of their respective seasons.

One reviewer observed that "like every other character, Sideshow Bob has become a one-dimensional shadow of himself, an intelligent murderous madman with seemingly no rhyme, reason or sense to his actions. This is such a bummer because of how amazingly written his episodes used to be."

Critics felt that instead of keeping the familiar Frasier dynamics (which worked well in Cecil's first appearance "Brother from Another Series"), the series took a different route with the Terwilliger family that didn't capitalize on the opportunity for "comedy gold."

### Fan Reception
- **IMDb Rating:** 7.1/10
- User reviews described it as "another great chilling, comedy" featuring "the masterminding, cunning and sadistic Sideshow Bob"
- Some fans appreciated the Frasier reunion aspect
- Others felt it was one of the weaker Sideshow Bob episodes

### Legacy
Despite mixed reviews, the episode is notable for:
- Being Kelsey Grammer's tenth appearance as the beloved character
- Successfully reuniting the Frasier cast in animated form
- Continuing the long-running Bart vs. Bob storyline
- Introducing Bob's parents to the Simpsons canon
