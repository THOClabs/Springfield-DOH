After the Simpson family embarrasses Homer at Mr. Burns' company picnic, Homer becomes obsessed with making them "normal."

Bart and Lisa have an argument. Homer intervenes, reminding everyone they're going to Mr. Burns' Employee Picnic and must be on their best behavior.

#### Scene 14: Dr. Monroe's Office - Shock Therapy
**Location:** Dr. Marvin Monroe's Family Therapy Center - Office
**Characters:** Dr. Marvin Monroe, Homer, Marge, Bart, Lisa, Maggie

In frustration, Monroe resorts to aversion therapy. He wires each family member to an electric generator. The concept: they can deliver shocks to one another to deter misbehavior.

However, the Simpsons immediately begin shocking each other relentlessly and with enthusiasm. Rather than learning to avoid negative behavior, they turn it into a competition.

The family shocks each other so many times and so intensely that:
- The generator becomes damaged

- Mr. Burns (elsewhere) notes the power drain with delight
- Monroe's other patients flee the building in terror

The family decides to use their $500 windfall to buy a new, bigger television. Everyone is delighted.

## Character Note: Role Reversal

This episode is notable for having the characters behave differently than in later episodes:

- **Homer** is the voice of reason and most responsible family member
- **Marge** gets drunk and acts irresponsibly
- **Lisa** is an undisciplined brat, indistinguishable from Bart

This reflects the show's early developmental stage. These roles were gradually reversed as the series found its footing.
