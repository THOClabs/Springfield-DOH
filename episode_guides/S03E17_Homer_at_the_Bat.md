## Synopsis

The Springfield Nuclear Power Plant softball team has an incredible season, led by Homer Simpson and his homemade "Wonder Bat" carved from a lightning-struck tree. As they head to the championship game against Shelbyville Nuclear Power Plant, Mr. Burns makes a million-dollar bet with Aristotle Amadopolis, the Shelbyville plant owner. Not trusting his workers, Burns hires nine Major League Baseball ringers - real-life players including Ken Griffey Jr., Steve Sax, Ozzie Smith, Roger Clemens, Wade Boggs, Jose Canseco, Don Mattingly, Darryl Strawberry, and Mike Scioscia - to ensure victory. The regular team members, including Homer, are benched. But through a series of absurd misfortunes, all nine ringers become unable to play: hypnotism, bar fights, toxic waste exposure, mystery ailments, arrest, gigantism, and getting lost in another dimension. With only Homer left, he steps up to bat in the ninth inning and gets hit by a pitch, winning the game by walking in the winning run. The team celebrates their unlikely victory.
