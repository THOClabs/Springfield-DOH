## Synopsis

When Principal Skinner organizes a "Go To Work With Your Parents Day" on the Friday before spring break, Bart ends up spending the day at the DMV with his aunts Patty and Selma. There, he manages to create a fake driver's license that lists him as 25 years old. Emboldened by his new ID, Bart recruits Milhouse, Nelson, and Martin Prince for an impromptu road trip. Using money Martin earned from the stock market, the boys rent a convertible and set out under the pretense of attending a "National Grammar Rodeo" in Canada. Their actual destination: the 1982 World's Fair in Knoxville, Tennessee. Unfortunately, they discover the fair ended years ago, and after Nelson wrecks their car, they're stranded far from home. Meanwhile, Lisa spends spring break at the nuclear plant with Homer, and the father-daughter duo must secretly orchestrate the boys' rescue without alerting Marge.
