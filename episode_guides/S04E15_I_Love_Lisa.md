## Synopsis

On Valentine's Day, Lisa Simpson gives Ralph Wiggum a valentine card out of pity when she sees that no one else gave him one. Ralph misinterprets the gesture as romantic interest and begins pursuing Lisa relentlessly. Using his father Chief Wiggum's influence and authority, Ralph secures Krusty the Clown show tickets for Lisa and the role of George Washington opposite Lisa's Martha Washington in the school's President's Day pageant. When Lisa publicly rejects Ralph on the Krusty the Clown Anniversary Show, Ralph channels his heartbreak into an emotionally powerful performance at the pageant. Afterward, Lisa apologizes and offers Ralph a new friendship card, and they reconcile.

**Characters:** Bill, Marty (radio DJs)

KBBL Radio plays "Monster Mash" by Bobby "Boris" Pickett.

**Marty:** "Doin' the Monster Mash with ya on this beautiful Valentine's Day."

**Bill:** "Marty, why did you play that song today? There must be thousands of love songs."

**Marty:** "It's kind of a love song. All the monsters enjoying each other's company, dancing, holding their evil in check."

**Bill:** "You played the wrong record, didn't you?"

**Marty:** "I sure did, Bill."

This establishes the comedic "bookend" structure - the episode begins and ends with "Monster Mash" being played on the wrong holiday.

He begins to cry quietly.

Lisa notices Ralph's pain. Feeling sorry for him, she reaches into her bag of valentines.

She gives Ralph a train-themed card that reads: "I Choo-Choo-Choose You!" with a picture of a train.

Ralph's face lights up. He interprets the card as a declaration of love.

**Location:** 742 Evergreen Terrace
**Characters:** Lisa, Ralph (via gift)

Lisa receives a package from Ralph.

#### Scene 14: The Mediocre Presidents Song
**Location:** Springfield Elementary Auditorium

The pageant opens with "The Mediocre Presidents" - a tribute to America's lesser-known presidents.

Featured presidents include:
- John Tyler
- Zachary Taylor

Despite his broken heart, Ralph must perform.

Ralph channels all his emotional pain into his performance as George Washington.

He delivers an unexpectedly powerful, moving portrayal that captivates the audience.

The performance is authentic and heartfelt - Ralph's real emotional devastation makes his acting extraordinary.

The audience is deeply moved. They give Ralph a thunderous standing ovation.

#### Scene 17: The Grand Finale
**Location:** Springfield Elementary Auditorium
**Characters:** Cast, audience, Principal Skinner

The pageant's finale features an elaborate set:
- George Washington's bed rises to the rafters

The spectacle is immediately undercut by Skinner's voice through Teddy Roosevelt's head urging the audience to buy orange drink.

#### Scene 18: Reconciliation
**Location:** Springfield Elementary - Backstage
**Characters:** Lisa, Ralph

After the pageant, Lisa approaches Ralph backstage.

She apologizes for humiliating him publicly and for being dishonest about her feelings.

Lisa gives Ralph a new card - this time, a friendship card.

Ralph accepts. He understands the difference now.

They reconcile as friends, not romantic partners.

#### Scene 19: Closing - Monster Mash Redux
**Location:** Springfield (radio)
**Characters:** Bill, Marty (radio DJs)

The episode ends on President's Day with KBBL Radio.

Bill and Marty accidentally play "Monster Mash" again - on yet another wrong holiday.
