## Synopsis

When Bart and Lisa go fishing near the Springfield Nuclear Power Plant, Bart catches a three-eyed mutant fish they name "Blinky." The discovery triggers a media frenzy and prompts Governor Mary Bailey to investigate the plant. Inspectors find 342 safety violations that would cost $56 million to fix. Rather than pay, Mr. Burns decides to run for governor so he can pass laws to eliminate the regulations threatening his plant. Homer supports Burns to protect his job, while Marge and Lisa back the incumbent Governor Bailey. The campaign reaches its climax at a televised dinner at the Simpson home, where Marge sabotages Burns by serving him Blinky. Unable to eat the mutated fish, Burns spits it out on camera, destroying his campaign and handing the election to Mary Bailey.

#### Scene 1: Fishing Near the Power Plant
**Location:** River downstream from Springfield Nuclear Power Plant
**Characters:** Bart, Lisa, Dave Shutton

Bart and Lisa are fishing in a river that runs near the Springfield Nuclear Power Plant.

Bart catches something unusual - a fish with three eyes.

**Bart:** Reels in the mutated fish, stunned by its appearance.

Dave Shutton, a reporter for the Springfield Shopper, happens to be nearby with his camera.

**Dave Shutton:** "Wait a minute. One, two... three?" - counting Blinky's eyes in disbelief.

He photographs Bart holding the three-eyed fish. This will become front-page news.

**Notable:** Blinky had previously made a brief appearance swimming in the lake outside the plant in the Season 1 episode "Homer's Odyssey." The writers liked the design and decided to build an episode around him.

#### Scene 2: Media Frenzy
**Location:** Springfield - Various
**Characters:** News Reporters, Townspeople, Simpson Family

The story of the three-eyed fish goes viral. "Blinky" becomes a sensation.

#### Scene 5: The Campaign Begins
**Location:** Various Campaign Venues
**Characters:** Mr. Burns, Campaign Staff, Voters

Burns launches his gubernatorial campaign against incumbent Mary Bailey.

His campaign advisors force him to smile, shake hands, and pretend to be a man of the people.

**Campaign Rally Scene:** Burns speaks before a massive poster of himself - a direct visual reference to Citizen Kane's famous rally scene.

#### Scene 6: The Darwin Commercial
**Location:** Television Studio / Simpson Living Room
**Characters:** Mr. Burns, Charles Darwin Actor, Simpson Family

Burns airs a campaign commercial featuring an actor portraying 19th-century scientist Charles Darwin.

**The Commercial's Claim:** Blinky isn't a mutation caused by nuclear waste - he's the next step in evolution! The three-eyed fish is a "natural" wonder that should be celebrated, not feared.

The commercial promises Burns will make Blinky "a tasty meal."

The Simpsons watch the commercial at home with varying reactions.

#### Scene 7: The Simpson Household Divided

Burns' campaign divides the Simpson family.

**Homer:** Supports Burns because antagonizing his boss could cost him his job. He wears a Burns campaign button.

**Marge:** Opposes Burns and supports Governor Mary Bailey. She sees through Burns' manipulation.

**Lisa:** Questions the ethics of supporting someone as corrupt as Burns. She confronts both parents about their positions.

---

### ACT THREE

#### Scene 9: The Dinner Invitation
**Location:** Springfield Nuclear Power Plant / Simpson Home
**Characters:** Mr. Burns, Smithers, Campaign Advisors, Homer

Burns' campaign team proposes a strategy: have Burns dine with an average working-class family the night before the election. The televised dinner will show his appeal to common voters.

The Simpsons are chosen as the "average family."

**Homer:** Accepts the invitation, thrilled to host his boss.

Campaign staff arrive at the Simpson home to prepare. They provide pre-written "softball" questions for the family to ask Burns on camera.

Marge is furious that her home is being used as a political prop.

#### Scene 10: Marge's Plan
**Location:** 742 Evergreen Terrace - Kitchen
**Characters:** Marge, Lisa

Marge gets an idea. She begins preparing a very special meal.

#### Scene 11: The Televised Dinner
**Location:** 742 Evergreen Terrace - Dining Room
**Characters:** Homer, Marge, Bart, Lisa, Maggie, Mr. Burns, Smithers, Campaign Staff, Media

The big night arrives. Cameras and reporters fill the Simpson home.

The dinner proceeds with awkward small talk. Burns attempts to seem relatable.

Then Marge brings out the main course.

#### Scene 12: Blinky is Served
**Location:** 742 Evergreen Terrace - Dining Room
**Characters:** Marge, Mr. Burns, Homer, Family, Media

Marge places the covered serving dish on the table.

She removes the lid to reveal: **Blinky the three-eyed fish.**

The fish's head is positioned directly on Mr. Burns' plate, all three eyes staring up at him.

Burns is trapped. His entire campaign has claimed Blinky is safe to eat - "a tasty meal."

The cameras are rolling. Millions are watching.

Burns hesitates. He looks at the mutated fish. His campaign advisors gesture frantically for him to eat it.

Burns takes a bite.

He immediately gags.

Unable to swallow the fish, Burns spits it out dramatically. The expelled bite flies through the air and hits the floor.

**Camera flashes explode.** The moment is captured forever.

Burns' campaign is destroyed in an instant.

---

### ACT FOUR

**Location:** Springfield - Various
**Characters:** Mary Bailey, Voters, News Anchors

**Characters:** Mr. Burns, Homer, Marge, Family

After the election, Burns returns to the Simpson home.

In a fit of rage, he destroys some of the Simpsons' furnishings - trashing the dining room in fury.

**Mr. Burns:** "This anonymous clan of slack-jawed troglodytes has cost me the election, and yet if I were to have them killed, I would be the one to go to jail. That's democracy for you."

**Smithers:** "You are noble and poetic in defeat, sir."

Burns issues a warning to Homer.

**Mr. Burns:** Threatens that he will ensure Homer's dreams will go unfulfilled for as long as he lives.

#### Scene 15: Resolution

Homer is shaken by Burns' threat. His future at the power plant seems uncertain.

**Marge:** (reassuringly) Points out that Homer's ambitions are so meagre that nobody could possibly thwart them.

This is oddly comforting to Homer.

**Marge to Lisa:** "Lisa, you're learning many lessons tonight, and one of them is to always give your mother the benefit of the doubt."

The family is reunited. Marge's sabotage has paradoxically brought them together.
