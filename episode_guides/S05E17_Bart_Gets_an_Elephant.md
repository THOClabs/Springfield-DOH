## Synopsis

Bart wins a KBBL radio contest and is offered the choice between $10,000 or a full-grown African elephant. Despite everyone's advice to take the money, Bart insists on the elephant, calling the DJs' bluff. The radio station, never expecting anyone to choose the elephant, reluctantly delivers "Stampy" to the Simpson home. The elephant causes chaos—eating massive amounts of food, destroying property, and attracting tourists. When the costs become unbearable, Homer considers selling Stampy to an ivory dealer. Instead, Lisa convinces the family to donate Stampy to an animal reserve, though not before Stampy saves Homer from a tar pit.
