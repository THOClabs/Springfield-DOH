## Synopsis

The fourth annual Treehouse of Horror features Bart as host in a "Night Gallery" parody, presenting three terrifying tales. In "The Devil and Homer Simpson," Homer sells his soul to the devil (Ned Flanders) for a donut. In "Terror at 5½ Feet," Bart sees a gremlin on his school bus but no one believes him. In "Bart Simpson's Dracula," the family visits Mr. Burns' castle and discovers he's a vampire who turns Bart into one of the undead. Each segment parodies classic horror/thriller stories while delivering the signature Simpsons humor.

**Devil Flanders:** "Hi-diddly-ho, neighbor! Did someone say... soul?"

**Bart:** "I was right! Doesn't that count for something?"

Final shot: The gremlin clings to the ambulance, holding Ned Flanders' head (from an earlier accident).

The family turns around. Marge has fangs and is floating.

**Marge:** "Well, I guess I should have told you. I'm the head vampire."

**Lisa:** "Mom?!"

**Marge:** "Come now, everyone. Let's celebrate as a family."

The entire family is now vampires (even Santa's Little Helper). They face the camera.

**All:** "Happy Halloween, everybody!"
