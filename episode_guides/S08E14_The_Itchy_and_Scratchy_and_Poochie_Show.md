## Synopsis

When ratings for The Itchy & Scratchy Show plummet, Krusty the Clown threatens to cancel the cartoon. Roger Meyers Jr., head of Itchy & Scratchy International, convenes a focus group of children (including Bart and Lisa) to discover what's wrong. The executives decide the show needs a new character with "attitude"—Poochie, a rapping, surfing, guitar-playing dog designed by committee. Homer auditions for the voice of Poochie and lands the role, competing against Otto and others. The debut episode is hyped like a major cultural event, but Poochie's in-your-face style bombs with audiences. Comic Book Guy declares it "Worst. Episode. Ever." When Homer overhears that Meyers plans to kill off Poochie, he improvises a heartfelt speech during his recording session, begging for the character's survival. The network overrules him, dubbing in a bizarre death scene where Poochie floats off-screen and dies "on the way back to his home planet." Meanwhile, a teenager named Roy inexplicably lives with the Simpsons without explanation—a meta-joke about network executives wanting to add a "new character" to the show.
