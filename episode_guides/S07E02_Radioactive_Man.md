## Synopsis

When Hollywood announces a big-budget film adaptation of the Radioactive Man comic book series, the production team decides to film in Springfield. The studio holds open auditions for a local child to play Fallout Boy, Radioactive Man's sidekick. Bart practices extensively and auditions, but is rejected for being "an inch too short." To everyone's surprise, the role goes to Milhouse, despite his initial reluctance. As filming progresses, Milhouse experiences the grueling reality of movie stardom—early call times, endless retakes, and dangerous stunts—while his parents begin spending his earnings lavishly. Eventually, Milhouse runs away and hides in Bart's treehouse, refusing to return. Even former child star Mickey Rooney cannot convince him. Without their Fallout Boy and with the city of Springfield having drained the production dry through excessive taxes and fees, the film is cancelled and the Hollywood crew returns home empty-handed.
