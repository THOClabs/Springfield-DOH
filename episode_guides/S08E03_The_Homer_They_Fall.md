## Synopsis

After Bart buys an extravagant belt at the mall but is promptly beaten up by school bullies who steal it, Homer goes to confront the bullies' fathers at Moe's Tavern. During the ensuing beating, Homer displays a remarkable ability to absorb punishment without being knocked down—a condition Dr. Hibbert later attributes to a genetic defect that makes his brain extra-cushioned within his skull. Seeing potential, Moe reveals his past as a boxer and proposes to manage Homer's boxing career. Since Homer can't throw a punch to save his life, Moe's strategy is simple: let opponents exhaust themselves hitting Homer, then push them over. After Homer defeats a series of underfed homeless opponents, the nefarious boxing promoter Lucius Sweet arranges a bout against heavyweight champion Drederick Tatum, recently released from prison. Despite promising Marge he'd pull Homer if things got dangerous, Moe lets the fight continue as Tatum brutalizes Homer. Just as Tatum is about to deliver a killing blow, Moe swoops in with Fan Man's paramotor and airlifts Homer to safety.
