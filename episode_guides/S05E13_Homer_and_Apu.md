## Synopsis

After Homer gets food poisoning from the Kwik-E-Mart and exposes Apu selling expired food on a hidden camera news exposé, Apu is fired from his job. Devastated and homeless, Apu moves in with the Simpsons to make amends. He tries to win back his job by impressing his employers, but the Kwik-E-Mart has already hired his replacement: Hollywood actor James Woods, who's researching a role. Apu and Homer travel to India to visit the head of Kwik-E-Mart's corporate headquarters and seek reinstatement. After a perilous journey to the mountaintop, the head office refuses to help. But when a robber shoots Apu (who saves James Woods' life), Apu is rehired as a hero and James Woods moves on to his next role.
