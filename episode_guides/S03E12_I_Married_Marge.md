## Synopsis

When Marge suspects she might be pregnant again, Homer tells Bart and Lisa the story of how he and Marge got married. In 1980, young Homer and Marge are dating and spending nights at a local miniature golf course watching movies at the drive-in theater next door. After their passions get the better of them, Marge discovers she's pregnant. Homer does the right thing and proposes, but struggles to provide for his new family. He takes a job at the Springfield Nuclear Power Plant to support Marge and the baby, but after a series of humiliations and his inability to afford a proper home, Homer leaves a note telling Marge she'd be better off without him. Marge tracks him down at the power plant and convinces him that they belong together. They marry at Shotgun Pete's wedding chapel, and shortly after, Bart is born. Back in the present, the family learns that Marge is not pregnant, but Homer realizes he'd be happy if she were.

**Mr. Burns:** "Hmm. You look like the kind of simple-minded fool who won't ask questions. You're hired."

**Young Marge:** "I'm not letting you leave me. We're a team, Homer. For better or worse."

**Young Homer:** "But I can't give you the life you deserve..."

**Young Marge:** "You ARE the life I want. I don't need fancy things. I need you."

**Marge:** (hanging up) "I'm not pregnant."

**Homer:** (relieved, then thoughtful) "Oh. Well... would it have been so bad?"

**Marge:** "Homer?"

**Homer:** "I mean, Maggie turned out great. And we survived Bart and Lisa. Maybe another kid wouldn't be the worst thing."
