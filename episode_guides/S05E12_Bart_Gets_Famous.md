## Synopsis

When Bart's class goes on an excruciatingly boring field trip to the Springfield Box Factory, Bart sneaks away and ends up at Channel 6 studios, where The Krusty the Clown Show is filmed. After stealing a Danish for Krusty, Bart becomes his new assistant - but the job is far from glamorous. When Bart is asked to fill in for a sick Sideshow Mel, he accidentally destroys the entire set and utters "I didn't do it!" The audience goes wild, and Bart becomes an instant celebrity based solely on this catchphrase. Fame brings merchandise, talk show appearances (including Late Night with Conan O'Brien), and public adoration - but Bart soon discovers that being a one-dimensional celebrity is hollow. When his catchphrase inevitably loses its appeal, Bart returns to normal life, and the episode ends with a meta-commentary on catchphrases as every character recites their signature lines - except Lisa, who has none.
