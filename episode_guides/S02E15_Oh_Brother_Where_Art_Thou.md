## Synopsis

When Grampa has a heart attack at a McBain movie, he confesses a long-held secret on what he believes is his deathbed: Homer has a half-brother. Grampa reveals that in his youth, he had an affair with a carnival hussy (a woman who guessed people's weight at a carnival), and she became pregnant. The baby was given up for adoption. After extensive searching through the Shelbyville Orphanage records, the Simpsons discover that Homer's half-brother is Herbert Powell - a wealthy automobile magnate who runs Powell Motors in Detroit. Homer travels to Detroit with his family to meet Herb, and the two instantly bond. Herb is so impressed with Homer's "average American" sensibilities that he puts Homer in charge of designing a new car for the common man. Despite warnings from his design team, Herb gives Homer complete creative control. The result is "The Homer" - an absurdly impractical, hideously ugly, and impossibly expensive car that bankrupt Powell Motors and destroys Herb's fortune. Herb disowns Homer, telling him he has no brother, and drives off penniless, leaving Homer devastated.

It's hideous. A monstrosity of design. Tailfins jut out at odd angles. The bubble dome looks ridiculous. It's enormous and garish.

The crowd gasps in horror.

**Board Member:** (checking price sheet) "Eighty-two thousand dollars?!"

**Press:** Begins murmuring and taking notes - this is a disaster.

#### Scene 16: The Fallout - Herb's Ruin
**Location:** Powell Motors Headquarters
**Characters:** Herb, Homer, Marge, Bart, Lisa
