## Framing Device

### The Treehouse
**Location:** Simpson backyard treehouse
**Characters:** Bart, Lisa, Maggie

On Halloween night, Bart and Lisa sit in the treehouse telling scary stories while Maggie listens. Each sibling takes turns narrating a horrifying tale.

### Opening Warning

Marge appears before the episode begins to deliver a special warning to parents:

**Marge:** Advises viewers to "tuck your children into bed early tonight, instead of writing us angry letters tomorrow."

This sets the tone for the series' ongoing tradition of Halloween content warnings.

## SEGMENT ONE: Bad Dream House

### Synopsis
The Simpsons purchase a suspiciously cheap house, only to discover it's built on an ancient Indian burial ground and is inhabited by malevolent spirits.

### Scene-by-Scene Breakdown

#### Scene 1: Moving In
**Location:** New House - Exterior/Interior
**Characters:** Homer, Marge, Bart, Lisa, Maggie, Moving Man (James Earl Jones)

The Simpsons arrive at their new home, purchased at an incredibly low price. A moving man (voiced by James Earl Jones) helps them unload.

The house immediately feels wrong - dark, foreboding, with an evil presence.

#### Scene 2: Strange Phenomena
**Location:** New House - Various Rooms
**Characters:** Homer, Marge, Bart, Lisa, Maggie

Strange events begin occurring:
- Walls drip blood
- A vortex opens in the kitchen

- An ominous voice echoes through the halls

Lisa and Marge sense evil, but Homer dismisses their concerns.

**Lisa:** Warns that the house is evil and they should leave.

#### Scene 3: The Indian Burial Ground
**Location:** New House - Basement
**Characters:** Lisa

Lisa discovers the house was built on an ancient Indian burial ground, explaining the supernatural activity.

#### Scene 4: The Possession
**Location:** New House - Various Rooms
**Characters:** Homer, Marge, Bart, Lisa, Maggie, House Voice (Harry Shearer)

The house begins possessing the family members, compelling them to violence.

The house whispers to Bart: "They are all against you, Bart... You must kill them all... They all must die!"

**Bart:** "Are you my conscience?"
**House:** "I– Yes! I am!"

The family members pick up knives and other weapons, turning on each other in a trance-like state.

#### Scene 5: Marge Confronts the House
**Location:** New House - Living Room
**Characters:** Marge, Homer, Bart, Lisa, Maggie, House Voice

Marge breaks free of the spell and confronts the supernatural entity directly.

**Marge:** "This family has had its differences and we've squabbled, but we've never had knife fights before, and I blame this house."

Marge demands the house either accept them or they'll leave.

#### Scene 6: The House's Decision
**Location:** New House
**Characters:** Simpson Family, House

The house considers living with the Simpsons... and decides death is preferable.

Rather than coexist with the Simpson family, the house chooses to destroy itself, imploding into another dimension.

The Simpsons are left standing in the empty lot.

## SEGMENT TWO: Hungry are the Damned

### Synopsis
The Simpson family is abducted by aliens who lavish them with food and luxury, but Lisa suspects their hosts have sinister intentions.

### Scene-by-Scene Breakdown

#### Scene 1: Backyard Abduction
**Location:** 742 Evergreen Terrace - Backyard
**Characters:** Homer, Marge, Bart, Lisa, Maggie

The Simpsons are having a barbecue when a UFO appears and beams them aboard.

#### Scene 2: Meeting the Aliens
**Location:** Alien Spaceship
**Characters:** Simpson Family, Kang, Kodos, Serak the Preparer

The family meets three aliens:
- **Kang** - One of the drooling tentacled aliens
- **Kodos** - Kang's sibling
- **Serak the Preparer** (voiced by James Earl Jones) - The ship's chef

**Notable First:** First appearance of Kang and Kodos, who would become recurring characters.

The aliens explain they're taking the Simpsons to their home planet, Rigel IV, for "a great feast."

**Kang:** "I am actually speaking Rigelian; by an astonishing coincidence, both of our languages are exactly the same."

#### Scene 3: The Lavish Treatment
**Location:** Alien Spaceship - Dining Area
**Characters:** Simpson Family, Kang, Kodos, Serak

The aliens present the Simpsons with enormous amounts of food:
- Elaborate feasts
- Endless courses
- Constant encouragement to eat more

The family gorges themselves, growing increasingly fat and content.

The aliens watch eagerly as the Simpsons eat.

#### Scene 4: Lisa's Suspicions
**Location:** Alien Spaceship - Kitchen
**Characters:** Lisa, Kang

Lisa grows suspicious of the aliens' hospitality. She sneaks into the kitchen and discovers a book.

The book's title appears to read: **"How to Cook Humans"**

Lisa is horrified - the aliens plan to eat them!

#### Scene 5: The Book Reveal
**Location:** Alien Spaceship - Main Chamber
**Characters:** Simpson Family, Kang, Kodos

Lisa confronts the aliens with the book.

Kang blows space dust off the cover, revealing more text: **"How To Cook for Humans"**

Lisa blows off more dust: **"How To Cook Forty Humans"**

Kang blows again: **"How To Cook for Forty Humans"**

The full title is completely innocent - the aliens were simply preparing a feast FOR the humans, not OF them.

#### Scene 6: The Return Home
**Location:** Alien Spaceship / Earth
**Characters:** Simpson Family, Kang, Kodos

The aliens are deeply offended by Lisa's accusation. They angrily return the Simpsons to Earth.

**Kang:** Rebukes the family for their mistrust, telling them they've ruined their chance at paradise on Rigel IV.

The Simpsons stand in their backyard, watching the ship depart. Lisa reflects that perhaps THEY were the real monsters.

### Cultural References - Hungry are the Damned
- **"To Serve Man"** - Classic Twilight Zone episode with similar twist about alien cookbook
- **Star Trek** - Kang and Kodos named after Trek characters (Klingon captain Kang; villain Kodos the Executioner)

### Production Note - Kang and Kodos

- James Earl Jones recorded his Serak lines separately, chewing a cookie near the microphone for drooling sounds
