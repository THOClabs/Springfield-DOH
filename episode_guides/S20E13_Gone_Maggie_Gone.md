## Synopsis

When a solar eclipse passes over Springfield, the Simpson family gathers to watch. After Homer's camera obscura breaks, Marge lends him hers—but when she takes a peek at the eclipse herself, she's temporarily blinded. Dr. Hibbert orders her eyes covered for two weeks with no stress. Without Marge in charge, rats invade the kitchen. Homer buys poison to kill them but faces a classic logic puzzle: how to cross a river with Santa's Little Helper, Maggie, and the poison when the rowboat only holds two items. Unable to solve it, he leaves Maggie on the doorstep of a convent—where the nuns take her in and refuse to return her. Lisa goes undercover as a nun to rescue her sister and discovers a centuries-old mystery involving a gem that will bring peace to the world. Following clues with help from Principal Skinner and Comic Book Guy, Lisa believes she is the "gem child" prophesied by St. Teresa of Ávila. However, the Mother Superior reveals the true gem child is Maggie, who creates a rainbow that brings harmony to Springfield. Marge bursts in, takes Maggie back (healing her eyes in the process), and the episode ends with Bart taking Maggie's place as the "gem child"—turning Springfield into a living hell.
