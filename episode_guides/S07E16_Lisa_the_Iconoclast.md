## Synopsis

As Springfield prepares for its bicentennial celebration, Lisa is assigned to write a school essay about town founder Jebediah Springfield. While researching at the Springfield Historical Society, she discovers a shocking secret hidden inside Jebediah's old fife: a written confession revealing that the beloved founder was actually Hans Sprungfeld, a murderous pirate who tried to assassinate George Washington and viewed Springfield's citizens with contempt.

Lisa presents her findings to museum curator Hollis Hurlbut, but he dismisses her claims as nonsense. At school, her teacher Miss Hoover gives her an "F" on the essay, calling it "dead-white-male bashing" and "PC thuggery." Undeterred, Lisa recruits Homer to help spread the truth. Homer, who has been selected as the town crier for the bicentennial celebrations due to his loud voice, uses his position to announce Lisa's findings. However, the townspeople react with anger rather than gratitude, calling Lisa's claims "hero-phobia."

To prove her theory, Lisa proposes exhuming Jebediah Springfield's grave to find his legendary silver prosthetic tongue (which replaced the one bitten off by "a Turk in a grog house fight"). When the grave is opened, the silver tongue is mysteriously absent. Lisa is about to give up when she receives a ghostly vision of George Washington, who points her toward a torn section of a portrait in the museum.

Lisa confronts Hollis Hurlbut, who finally confesses that he discovered the silver tongue years ago but concealed it to protect Jebediah's heroic legacy - and his own career as the museum's curator. With the evidence finally in hand, Lisa prepares to reveal the truth at the bicentennial parade.

However, watching the joyful celebration and seeing how the myth of Jebediah Springfield brings out the best in her community, Lisa makes a difficult decision. She chooses to keep the secret, telling the crowd that Jebediah Springfield was indeed a great man. The myth, she realizes, serves a greater purpose than historical accuracy - it inspires people to be their best selves.

The crowd cheers. Homer approaches Lisa, confused.

**Homer:** "But Lisa, you had the proof. Why didn't you tell them?"
