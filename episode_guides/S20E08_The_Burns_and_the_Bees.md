## Plot Summary

### Act One: Billionaire Camp and the Basketball Team

The episode opens at Billionaire Camp, an exclusive retreat for the ultra-wealthy. Mr. Burns participates in various activities with fellow billionaires including shooting famous paintings (Mona Lisa, Whistler's Mother, The Scream), playing Quidditch, and a poker game. During the poker game, Burns wins the Austin Celtics basketball franchise from the Rich Texan.

Burns brings the team to Springfield and renames them the Springfield Excitement. However, his first game as owner is a disaster when he shoots what he believes is a live gorilla mascot, not realizing it's actually a man in a costume, killing the mascot in front of the horrified crowd.

### Act Two: Lisa's Bee Crisis

Meanwhile, at Springfield Elementary, Jimbo, Dolph, and Kearney dare Bart to prank the second graders by hitting a beehive with his slingshot. When Bart complies, Lisa discovers all the bees in the hive are dead.

Groundskeeper Willie explains to Lisa that bees are dying all over the world, from Glasgow to Edinburgh (and everywhere in between). Professor Frink examines the bees and diagnoses them with "bee measles" or "beesles" - red spots indicating a fatal disease affecting the global bee population.

Lisa becomes determined to save the bees. She convinces a reluctant Homer to help by showing him a dystopian vision of a honey-less future where a WALL-E-like robot compacts Homer into a garbage cube. Homer calls flowers "the painted whores of the plant world" before Lisa explains the critical role of bees in pollination.

Professor Frink has an uninfected queen bee sting Lisa, releasing pheromones that attract many healthy bees, which form a bee beard on Lisa's face. After attempting to keep the bees at home (with Homer insisting the breakfast bees are "just drones" with only 5-minute lifespans and haploid cells), Lisa and Marge find an abandoned greenhouse to serve as a bee sanctuary.

### Act Three: The Stadium Conflict

Mr. Burns attends a Dallas Mavericks game and witnesses owner Mark Cuban's over-the-top crowd-pleasing antics. Fascinated by Cuban's enthusiastic ownership style (with Smithers asking "Who is that man, and why is his enthusiasm not being punished?"), Burns decides to emulate him by building a brand new, state-of-the-art sports arena in Springfield.

Unfortunately, Burns plans to build the arena on the exact location of Lisa's bee sanctuary. At a town hall meeting, Lisa protests the destruction of the bee habitat, but Burns dismisses her concerns, declaring "I can, I am, and soon I shall have been. I'm unstoppable!"

### Act Four: Homer's Solution and Resolution

To save the bees, Homer and Moe devise a plan to create a hybrid bee species. Moe reveals he has Africanized "killer" bees, which he obtained from responding to a magazine ad for "excited African honeys." They breed Lisa's docile European honeybees with Moe's aggressive Africanized bees to create a stronger hybrid species capable of surviving anywhere.

Six weeks later, on the night of the grand opening of Burns' new arena, Homer takes Lisa to the top of a hill to show her the thriving hybrid bee colony. However, Homer accidentally releases the bees. The swarm is attracted to Burns' arena because its dome structure resembles a massive beehive.

The African hybrid bees invade the stadium during the opening event, attacking everyone inside. Burns opens the retractable roof in an attempt to let them escape, but this only makes the situation worse as more bees pour in. The arena is legally declared a bee sanctuary, allowing the bees to survive.

### Epilogue

One year later at the next Billionaire Camp retreat, Burns reveals the bee incident cost him $804 million in losses. His accountant informs him he is now worth $996,036,000 - four million dollars short of the billion-dollar threshold required for membership. Burns is kicked out of Billionaire Camp and relegated to Millionaire Camp, where he is horrified to find millionaires who made their money through "low-class" businesses like minor-league hockey teams. Burns pleads "Can't you do it for old times' sake?" (echoing Tessio's plea in The Godfather), but to no avail.

## Legacy and Impact

While receiving mixed reviews upon release, "The Burns and the Bees" addressed the timely environmental issue of bee population decline during the height of Colony Collapse Disorder awareness. The episode's nomination for an Environmental Media Award recognized its attempt to bring attention to pollinator conservation.

The episode represents the ongoing challenge of later-era Simpsons episodes balancing social commentary with comedy, with critics divided on whether it succeeded at either goal. However, its accurate mathematical continuity regarding Burns' financial losses and the detailed cultural references demonstrate the show's continued attention to detail in production.
