Grampa Simpson falls in love with Beatrice "Bea" Simmons, a fellow resident at the Springfield Retirement Castle. When Homer forces Grampa to attend a discount lion safari on Bea's birthday, Grampa misses his date with her. Tragically, Bea dies that same day from a burst ventricle.

At the Springfield Retirement Castle, Grampa gets his pills mixed up with those of an elderly widow named Beatrice Simmons. This accidental encounter leads to conversation, and the two elderly people immediately hit it off.

**Notable First:** Grampa's full name "Abraham Simpson" is revealed for the first time.

#### Scene 2: A Romance Blooms
**Location:** Springfield Retirement Castle
**Characters:** Grampa, Bea

Grampa and Bea begin dating. Their romance blossoms as they spend time together at the retirement home. The scenes show their genuine connection and happiness in finding love at their advanced age.

**Visual Reference:** The scene where Grampa and Bea eat their pills seductively parodies the famous eating scene from the 1963 film "Tom Jones."

#### Scene 3: Simpson Family "Fun Day with Grampa"
**Location:** Simpson Home / Discount Lion Safari
**Characters:** Homer, Marge, Bart, Lisa, Maggie, Grampa

Homer insists that Grampa join the rest of the Simpsons for their scheduled "fun day with Grampa" at a cheap discount lion safari. Grampa protests that he has plans - it's Bea's birthday and he needs to celebrate with her.

Homer dismisses Bea as a figment of Grampa's imagination, refusing to believe his father has a girlfriend.

Despite Grampa's protests, the family drags him along to the safari.

#### Scene 4: Trapped at the Safari
**Location:** Discount Lion Safari Park
**Characters:** Simpson family, lions

At the wild animal park, the family's car becomes surrounded by lions. They are trapped inside the vehicle for hours, unable to leave as the animals circle their car menacingly.

The extended wait means Grampa is missing Bea's birthday celebration entirely.

#### Scene 5: Tragic Return
**Location:** Springfield Retirement Castle
**Characters:** Grampa, retirement home staff

When the Simpsons finally return to the retirement home after escaping the safari, Grampa rushes to find Bea.

Grampa is heartbroken and furious at Homer for taking him away.

**Location:** Law Office / Retirement Castle
**Characters:** Grampa, Lionel Hutz, Homer

Lionel Hutz, a shady lawyer, reads Bea's will. Grampa learns that Bea has left him her entire estate: $106,000.

Grampa immediately calls Homer to tell him one thing: Homer is NOT getting any of the inheritance. This is Grampa's money, and he plans to spend it on himself.

#### Scene 7: Grampa's Shopping Spree
**Location:** Various Springfield locations
**Characters:** Grampa

Grampa attempts to find happiness by spending the money on himself. He goes on a shopping spree, buying expensive items and treating himself to luxuries.

However, material possessions fail to fill the void left by Bea's death.

#### Scene 8: The Ghost on the Rollercoaster
**Location:** Amusement Park
**Characters:** Grampa, Bea's Ghost

Grampa visits an amusement park, riding a rollercoaster. During the ride, Bea's ghost appears to him.

Bea's spirit encourages Grampa to use the money to help others rather than spending it selfishly on himself. She wants her legacy to make a positive difference in people's lives.

This supernatural encounter changes Grampa's perspective entirely.

#### Scene 9: The Petitioners
**Location:** Springfield Retirement Castle
**Characters:** Grampa, various Springfield residents (including Professor Frink, Darth Vader, The Joker)

Word spreads that Grampa has money to give away, and Springfield residents line up with proposals for how he should spend it.

Notable petitioners include:
- **Professor Frink** (first appearance) - Pitches a strange invention
- **Darth Vader** - Wants funding
- **The Joker** - Also seeking money

The proposals are almost universally frivolous, greedy, or outright destructive. Grampa is disgusted by the parade of selfish requests.

---

### ACT THREE

#### Scene 10: A Walk Through Springfield
**Location:** Springfield streets, downtown
**Characters:** Grampa, homeless residents

Overwhelmed by the greedy petitioners, Grampa goes for a walk to clear his mind. During his walk through Springfield, he encounters the city's homeless population.

Seeing their plight firsthand, Grampa realizes the true scope of Springfield's problems. He also realizes that $106,000, while substantial, isn't enough money to solve all of the city's issues.

**Visual Reference:** The shot of Grampa sitting alone at a diner resembles the famous 1942 Edward Hopper painting "Nighthawks."

#### Scene 11: The Gambling Scheme
**Location:** Casino Bus / Casino
**Characters:** Grampa, Jasper, Homer, other seniors

Jasper suggests a solution: if Grampa wants to help more people, he needs more money. He can multiply his inheritance by gambling!

Grampa joins a casino bus trip with other seniors, planning to win big so he can help everybody in Springfield.

At the casino, things don't go well. Grampa begins losing money at the tables.

#### Scene 12: Homer's Intervention
**Location:** Casino
**Characters:** Homer, Grampa

Homer arrives at the casino and successfully stops Grampa from gambling away (and losing) everything.

In this moment, Homer and Grampa reconcile. Grampa forgives Homer for the safari incident that caused him to miss Bea's last day.

They share a father-son moment of understanding.

#### Scene 13: The Revelation
**Location:** Casino parking lot / Bus
**Characters:** Grampa, Homer, Jasper, retirement home residents

As Grampa sees his elderly friends piling onto the bus for the ride back home, he has a realization about where his money should go.

These are his people - the residents of the Springfield Retirement Castle. They've been his family during his twilight years. This is where Bea lived and where she would want to be remembered.

#### Scene 14: The Beatrice Simmons Dining Room
**Location:** Springfield Retirement Castle
**Characters:** Grampa, retirement home residents, Simpson family

Grampa uses his entire inheritance to renovate and improve the Springfield Retirement Castle. The centerpiece of his contribution is the creation of "The Beatrice Simmons Dining Room."

The dining room is dedicated to Bea's memory, ensuring that her legacy lives on in a place that benefits her fellow seniors every day.

The episode ends with Grampa at peace, having honored Bea in a meaningful way that helps others.

**Visual Reference:** The finale references the ending of the 1932 film "If I Had a Million."
