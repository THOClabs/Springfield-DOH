## Synopsis

When the Springfield Lottery jackpot reaches $130 million, the entire town goes lottery-crazy - including Homer, who spends the family's savings on tickets. Meanwhile, the family dog Santa's Little Helper becomes seriously ill with a twisted stomach that requires emergency surgery costing $750. To afford the operation, every family member must make painful sacrifices: Homer gives up beer, Marge skips buying lottery tickets, Bart gets a terrible haircut at the barber college, Lisa can't buy her encyclopedia volume, and Maggie's clothes must last longer. Although the surgery saves Santa's Little Helper's life, the family begins to resent him for the sacrifices they've made, treating him coldly and blaming him for their hardships. Heartbroken by the rejection, Santa's Little Helper runs away and ends up at Mr. Burns' mansion, where Burns uses Clockwork Orange-style conditioning to transform him into a vicious attack dog. When Bart finally tracks down his beloved pet, the memories of their bond break through the brainwashing, and Santa's Little Helper chooses his family over his new violent programming.
