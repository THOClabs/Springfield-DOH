## Synopsis

Mr. Burns falls critically ill with hypohemia, a rare blood disorder, and desperately needs a transfusion of double-O-negative blood. Homer discovers that Bart has this rare blood type and convinces him to donate, promising they'll be rewarded by the wealthy Burns. After the successful transfusion saves Burns' life, the family receives only a simple thank-you card. Furious, Homer writes an angry letter to Burns, but Marge prevents him from mailing it. However, Bart accidentally sends it the next morning. Homer's frantic attempts to retrieve the letter fail, and Burns reads the scathing note. Initially seeking revenge, Burns is convinced by Smithers that Homer saved his life. Burns buys the Simpsons an extravagant gift: a rare Olmec head statue called Xtapolapocetl. The episode ends with the family unable to determine the moral of their experience - Homer concluding it's "just a bunch of stuff that happened."

### ACT ONE

#### Scene 1: Springfield Nuclear Power Plant - The Announcement
**Location:** Springfield Nuclear Power Plant
**Characters:** Smithers, Plant Employees, Homer

Mr. Burns has fallen critically ill.

**Smithers:** Announces to the plant employees that Burns is dying from hypohemia - a rare condition where the body fails to produce enough blood.

Burns desperately needs a blood transfusion of an extremely rare type: double-O-negative.

Smithers appeals to all employees: if anyone has this blood type, Burns' life depends on them.

**Homer:** Immediately volunteers, dreaming of a reward from the wealthy Burns.

#### Scene 2: Simpson Home - The Discovery
**Location:** 742 Evergreen Terrace
**Characters:** Homer, Marge, Bart

Homer rushes home, excited about the opportunity.

**Homer:** Tells Marge about Burns' need for blood. He's certain a rich man will reward them handsomely.

**The Problem:** Homer doesn't have double-O-negative blood.

**Marge:** Recalls that Bart has this rare blood type.

Homer now has a plan - Bart will be the donor.

#### Scene 3: Convincing Bart
**Location:** 742 Evergreen Terrace
**Characters:** Homer, Bart

Bart is reluctant to donate blood.

**Homer:** Convinces him with promises of riches. "Save a rich man's life, he will shower you with money."

Homer paints pictures of the rewards they'll receive - money, gifts, perhaps even a car.

Bart agrees to donate.

#### Scene 4: The Blood Donation
**Location:** Hospital/Blood Bank
**Characters:** Bart, Medical Staff

Bart donates his rare blood.

The transfusion is a success.

Mr. Burns receives the life-saving blood and begins to recover.

#### Scene 5: Burns Recovers
**Location:** Burns Manor
**Characters:** Mr. Burns, Smithers

Mr. Burns makes a full recovery thanks to Bart's blood.

He's restored to his former vitality (or at least, his former frailty).

Burns decides to send a thank-you to the family who saved him.

---

### ACT TWO

#### Scene 6: The Thank-You Card
**Location:** 742 Evergreen Terrace
**Characters:** Homer, Marge, Bart, Lisa

The family eagerly awaits their reward from Mr. Burns.

A letter arrives from Burns Manor.

**Homer:** Opens it excitedly, expecting a check or news of a grand gift.

**The Contents:** A simple thank-you card. Nothing more.

Homer is outraged. His son saved a billionaire's life and all they get is a card?

#### Scene 7: Homer Writes the Letter
**Location:** 742 Evergreen Terrace
**Characters:** Homer, Bart, Marge

Homer decides to express his displeasure.

**Homer:** Dictates an extremely angry, hateful letter to Mr. Burns, with Bart writing it down.

The letter is scathing - calling Burns out for his ingratitude and selfishness.

**Marge:** Intervenes before Homer can mail it. She takes the letter away and convinces him not to send it.

Homer reluctantly agrees. The letter is left on the table.

#### Scene 8: The Letter Gets Mailed
**Location:** 742 Evergreen Terrace - Morning
**Characters:** Bart, Homer

The next morning.

Homer realizes he needs to destroy the angry letter before he's tempted to send it.

**The Problem:** The letter is gone.

**Bart:** Innocently reveals that he mailed it that morning, thinking he was helping.

Homer panics. That letter will destroy him if Burns reads it.

---

### ACT THREE

#### Scene 9: Homer Tries to Stop the Mail
**Location:** Post Office, Mail Routes
**Characters:** Homer, Postal Workers

Homer launches a desperate mission to retrieve the letter before it reaches Burns.

He tries everything:
- Begging postal workers
- Attempting to intercept mail trucks
- Racing the mail delivery

**Flintstones Reference:** Homer's attempts to stop the mail are reminiscent of similar scenes in The Flintstones.

All attempts fail. The letter is delivered to Burns Manor.

#### Scene 10: Burns Reads the Letter
**Location:** Burns Manor - Office
**Characters:** Mr. Burns, Smithers, Homer

Homer is summoned to Burns' office.

Burns begins reading the letter aloud.

**Burns:** Initially pleased by the opening ("Dear Mr. Burns...")

But before Homer can escape, Burns continues reading and discovers the hateful content.

Burns is furious. His face contorts with rage.

**Burns:** Fires Homer on the spot.

#### Scene 11: Burns Seeks Revenge
**Location:** Burns Manor
**Characters:** Mr. Burns, Smithers

Burns decides a simple firing isn't enough.

**Burns:** "Revenge is a dish best served cold." He wants Homer "beaten to a pulp."

He orders Smithers to have Homer physically attacked.

**Smithers:** Refuses.

This is a pivotal character moment for Smithers - his loyalty to Burns conflicts with his moral principles.

**Smithers:** Argues that beating Homer is no way to repay the family that saved Burns' life.

Burns pauses to consider this.

#### Scene 12: Burns Reconsiders
**Location:** Burns Manor
**Characters:** Mr. Burns, Smithers

Smithers' words sink in.

The Simpsons DID save Burns' life. Bart's blood restored him.

Burns realizes he must do something more than a thank-you card.

He decides to buy them a proper gift - something worthy of saving a life.

---

### ACT FOUR

#### Scene 13: Plunderer Pete's
**Location:** Springfield Mall - Plunderer Pete's Store
**Characters:** Mr. Burns

Burns goes to the Springfield Mall to find a gift.

He enters "Plunderer Pete's" - a store specializing in rare antiquities.

**The Perfect Gift:** Burns spots a massive Olmec head statue.

**Price:** $32,000

**Burns:** Identifies it as "Xtapolapocetl, god of war" (incorrectly - this is a made-up name).

He purchases it for the Simpsons.

**Historical Note:** The Olmec head is presented as ancient and valuable, though Burns' identification of it as a "god of war" named Xtapolapocetl is culturally inaccurate - the name sounds Nahuatl (Aztec), not Olmec.

#### Scene 14: The Gift Arrives
**Location:** 742 Evergreen Terrace
**Characters:** Homer, Marge, Bart, Lisa, Maggie, Delivery Workers

A massive delivery arrives at the Simpson home.

The enormous Olmec head statue is installed.

**Bart:** Thinks it's cool. He's genuinely pleased with the exotic gift.

**Homer:** Is not satisfied. He wanted money, not a giant stone head.

#### Scene 15: What's the Moral?
**Location:** 742 Evergreen Terrace
**Characters:** Homer, Marge, Bart, Lisa

The family gathers around the Olmec head, trying to make sense of their experience.

**The Debate:** What is the moral of this story?

- Is it "A good deed is its own reward"? No - Bart DID get a reward he likes.
- Is it "No good deed goes unrewarded"? No - they wouldn't have received anything if Homer hadn't written the angry letter.

**Homer:** Concludes that there is no moral. "It's just a bunch of stuff that happened."

**Marge:** "It certainly was a memorable few days."

The episode ends without a tidy resolution - deliberately mocking sitcom conventions of neat moral lessons.
