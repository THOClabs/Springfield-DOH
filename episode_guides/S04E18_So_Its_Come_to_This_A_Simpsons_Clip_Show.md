## Synopsis

On April Fools' Day, Bart plays an escalating series of pranks on Homer. When Homer catches on and threatens revenge, Bart enlists Lisa's help to create the ultimate prank: a beer can shaken by an industrial paint mixer. When Homer opens the violently shaken Duff can, the explosion is so powerful it puts him in a coma. As the family gathers at the hospital, fearing the worst, they reminisce about their lives with Homer through flashback clips from previous episodes. Eventually Homer wakes from his coma, seemingly fine, but when Barney tries to cheer him up with a candy bar, the vending machine falls and crushes Homer. At the hospital again, the family continues their vigil as Homer finally recovers.
