## Synopsis

After Springfield is ranked "America's Crappiest City," Marge organizes a film festival to improve the town's image. She invites famed New York film critic Jay Sherman (from the animated series "The Critic") to judge. Homer insists on being added as a judge to prove his intelligence. Various townspeople submit films, including Mr. Burns' self-aggrandizing biography directed by "Señor Spielbergo" (Steven Spielberg's non-union Mexican equivalent). Homer initially votes for Hans Moleman's "Man Getting Hit by Football" but is eventually convinced by Jay to appreciate Barney's moving film about alcoholism, "Pukahontas," which wins the festival.
