## Synopsis

When the Simpson family gathers to encourage baby Maggie to say her first word, Marge tells the story of when Lisa said her first word. The episode flashes back to 1983-1984, when Homer, Marge, and toddler Bart lived in a tiny apartment on the Lower East Side of Springfield. With another baby on the way, the family searches for a bigger home and eventually purchases 742 Evergreen Terrace from Grampa Simpson (who sells his house to give them the money). Young Bart struggles with jealousy over his new baby sister, especially when Homer builds him a terrifying clown bed to free up the crib. Meanwhile, Krusty the Clown's Olympic promotion at Krusty Burger backfires spectacularly when the Soviet Union boycotts the 1984 Games. The episode culminates emotionally when Lisa's first word turns out to be "Bart" - winning over her jealous brother. In a touching coda, after the family goes to sleep, Maggie speaks her first word alone: "Daddy."
