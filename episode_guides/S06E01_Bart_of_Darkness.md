## Synopsis

During a scorching Springfield heatwave, Bart and Lisa convince Homer to buy a backyard pool. The pool makes the Simpson kids the most popular in the neighborhood - until Bart breaks his leg attempting a dangerous dive from the treehouse. Confined to his room for the summer, Bart uses Lisa's telescope to spy on neighbors. When he witnesses Ned Flanders digging in his backyard at night and hears a feminine scream, Bart becomes convinced Ned has murdered his wife Maude. Lisa investigates but gets trapped in the Flanders house. The truth is revealed: Maude was at Bible camp, and Ned's "murder victim" was actually Maude's beloved ficus plant, which he accidentally overwatered.

The next day, he overhears Ned talking to Rod and Todd:

#### Scene 12: Lisa Investigates

#### Scene 14: The Reveal
**Location:** Flanders House / Backyard
**Characters:** Bart, Lisa, Homer, Marge, Ned, Maude, Rod, Todd, Chief Wiggum, police

The police arrive at the Flanders house.

Maude Flanders walks in - alive and well.

Everyone is confused. If Maude wasn't murdered, what was Ned burying?

Bart demands an explanation about the grave in the backyard.

#### Scene 15: The Truth About the Ficus
**Location:** Flanders Backyard
**Characters:** Bart, Lisa, Ned, Maude, police

Ned tearfully confesses the truth.

While Maude was away, Ned was responsible for her beloved ficus plant.

He overwatered it, and the plant died.

Panicking, he buried the dead plant in the backyard.

The police unearth the "body" - it's the dead houseplant.

Ned sees his horticultural failure exposed and lets out a high-pitched scream.

Bart recognizes it - that's the "feminine scream" he heard!

**Production Note:** Ned's feminine scream was performed by Tress MacNeille, not Harry Shearer.

#### Scene 16: Resolution
**Location:** 742 Evergreen Terrace
**Characters:** Bart, Lisa, Homer, Marge

The mystery is solved. Ned is innocent - just a terrible plant caretaker.

Bart's leg will heal, and the summer continues.

Lisa has gained new respect for Bart's detective instincts, even if he was wrong.

The episode ends with the family back to normal.
