## Synopsis

When Mr. Burns implements a mandatory exercise program at the Springfield Nuclear Power Plant, Homer desperately seeks any way to avoid the physical exertion. After learning that employees classified as disabled can work from home through worker's compensation, Homer unsuccessfully attempts to injure himself. Upon discovering that employees weighing 300 pounds or more qualify as disabled under hyper-obesity, Homer devises a scheme to intentionally gain 61 pounds. Despite Marge and Lisa's repeated warnings about his health, Homer—with enthusiastic assistance from Bart and dubious medical advice from Dr. Nick Riviera—embarks on an extreme eating regimen. Eventually consuming everything in the house including a Play-Doh donut made by Maggie, Homer reaches 315 pounds and achieves his goal of working from home. However, when his assigned task of monitoring a computer terminal leads to disaster after he leaves a drinking bird to press the "Y" key while he goes to the movies, Homer must rush to the plant to prevent a nuclear meltdown. Ironically, his newly massive body becomes the only thing capable of plugging the toxic gas release tube, saving Springfield. Mr. Burns rewards Homer by funding liposuction surgery after his exercise-based weight loss program fails.

Homer desperately tries to avoid participating, hiding in bathrooms and behind equipment.

**Location:** Power Plant Office / Personnel Files
**Characters:** Homer, Smithers, Mr. Burns

Homer discovers in the employee handbook that "hyper-obesity" (weighing 300 pounds or more) qualifies as a disability. Since he currently weighs 239 pounds, he needs to gain 61 pounds.

**Marge:** "Are you out of your mind? Have you thought about your health?"

**Homer:** "So that's it, isn't it, Marge? Looks. I never knew you were so shallow."

Marge tries to explain her concerns are health-based, not appearance-based.

Homer deliberately misinterprets her support and cuts her off before she can finish.
