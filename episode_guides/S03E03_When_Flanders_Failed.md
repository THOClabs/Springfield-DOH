After everyone has eaten, Ned makes a shocking announcement: he's quitting his job in pharmaceuticals to pursue his dream.

**Notable First:** First mention of The Leftorium.

#### Scene 3: The Wishbone
**Location:** Flanders Backyard
**Characters:** Homer, Ned, Maude

Maude presents Homer and Ned with the wishbone from the turkey. She suggests they each make a wish and pull.

Homer initially dismisses this as stupid, but Ned encourages him to think of something he wants.

#### Scene 4: Akira's Karate School
**Location:** Akira's Karate Dojo
**Characters:** Bart, Akira, karate students

Bart begins taking karate lessons from Akira (voiced by Hank Azaria doing a George Takei impression).

**Akira:** "We learn karate, so we need never use it."

**Bart:** "Um, excuse me, sir, I already know how not to hit a guy. Can we break out the nunchuks?"

Akira assigns the class to read **The Art of War** by Sun Tzu. Bart is immediately bored with the philosophical approach to martial arts.

**Production Note:** A poster in the dojo reads "Akira hangs out in Neo-Tokyo" in Japanese - a reference to the anime film "Akira."

**Location:** Simpson Home
**Characters:** Homer, Marge
