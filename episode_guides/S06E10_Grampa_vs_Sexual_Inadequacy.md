When Homer and Marge's love life becomes stale, Grampa reveals he has an old family recipe for a potent love tonic called "Simpson & Son Revitalizing Tonic." Homer and Grampa go into business selling the tonic door-to-door across small-town America, rekindling their father-son relationship. However, their partnership collapses when Grampa, in a moment of anger, reveals that Homer was an "accident" who ruined his life. Homer is devastated, and the two become estranged. Meanwhile, the kids, left alone repeatedly, develop conspiracy theories about why adults keep disappearing.
