## Synopsis

Homer accidentally invents a new drink by mixing the dregs from various liquor bottles with children's cough syrup, then accidentally setting it on fire when his sisters-in-law's cigarette ash falls into it. He names it the "Flaming Homer" and shares the recipe with his friend Moe. Sensing opportunity, Moe steals the recipe, renames it the "Flaming Moe," and claims credit as the inventor. The drink becomes wildly popular, transforming Moe's Tavern into Springfield's hottest nightspot and attracting celebrities like Aerosmith. Homer, bitter about the betrayal, becomes obsessed with revenge. When a restaurant chain offers Moe $1 million for the secret recipe, Homer dramatically reveals the secret ingredient - cough syrup - destroying the drink's exclusivity and Moe's fortune. The two eventually reconcile over a complimentary Flaming Homer.
