## Synopsis

When the Springfield Nuclear Power Plant is forced to hire a female employee after a safety inspection, Homer's new coworker is Mindy Simmons—a beautiful, intelligent woman who shares all his interests: donuts, beer, TV, and napping. Homer finds himself dangerously attracted to Mindy, and his feelings are reciprocated. Despite romantic fantasies and Mindy's obvious appeal, Homer remains committed to Marge. When both are sent to a convention in Capital City, Homer and Mindy nearly give in to temptation but Homer ultimately stays faithful. Meanwhile, Bart's medical issues require ugly glasses, orthopedic shoes, and skin cream, temporarily transforming him into a nerd who becomes friends with Martin Prince.
