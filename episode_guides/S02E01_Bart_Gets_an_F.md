## Synopsis

Bart faces his biggest academic challenge yet when Mrs. Krabappel threatens to hold him back in fourth grade due to his failing grades. After bombing a book report on "Treasure Island" and failing a Colonial America history test, Bart is told he must pass the next exam or repeat the grade. Desperate, he strikes a deal with class brain Martin Prince: tutoring in exchange for lessons on being cool. When Martin abandons studying to embrace his newfound popularity, Bart turns to prayer and asks for a snow day. His wish is granted, and while all of Springfield enjoys the snow, Bart forces himself to study. Despite his genuine effort, he scores a 59 - still failing. But when his tearful breakdown reveals unexpected historical knowledge about George Washington at Fort Necessity, Mrs. Krabappel awards him one extra point, giving him a D-minus - the lowest passing grade.

### ACT THREE

#### Scene 10: Simpson Home - The Deal with Martin
**Location:** 742 Evergreen Terrace
**Characters:** Bart, Martin Prince

Desperate for help, Bart approaches Martin Prince with a proposal.

Martin agrees. They begin their arrangement.

#### Scene 11: Tutoring Sessions and Cool Lessons
**Location:** Various - School, Simpson Home
**Characters:** Bart, Martin

The training begins on both fronts:
- Martin teaches Bart about Colonial American history
- Bart teaches Martin how to act cool, talk to other kids, and shed his nerdy image

**Martin's Transformation:** For the first time, we see Martin wearing something other than his usual outfit. He slicks back his hair, wears a Hawaiian shirt and sunglasses.

The tutoring seems to be working for both of them.

#### Scene 12: Martin's Betrayal
**Location:** Springfield Elementary
**Characters:** Martin, Bart, Other Students

Martin's popularity lessons work too well. He quickly becomes accepted by the cool kids.

Intoxicated by his newfound social status, Martin abandons his commitment to help Bart study.

**Martin:** Decides that tests no longer matter now that he's popular.

Bart is left without a tutor, back at square one.

#### Scene 13: Bart's Prayer
**Location:** 742 Evergreen Terrace - Bart's Bedroom
**Characters:** Bart

The night before his final chance test, Bart is desperate.

He turns to prayer, asking God for a snow day - just one more day to study.

#### Scene 14: The Snow Day
**Location:** Springfield - Various
**Characters:** Bart, Lisa, Homer, Marge, Springfield Residents

Bart wakes up to find his prayer has been answered. Springfield is covered in snow. Schools are closed.

Everyone in Springfield celebrates. An elaborate snowball fight breaks out. The scene shows the entire town enjoying the unexpected holiday.

**Notable Animation:** Director David Silverman has said this snow day sequence "was the most difficult thing he's had to animate" due to the panoramic shots and numerous characters.

**Visual Easter Egg:** Principal Skinner and Mrs. Krabappel are shown holding hands during the snow festivities - the first hint of their potential relationship.

#### Scene 15: Bart Studies While Springfield Plays
**Location:** 742 Evergreen Terrace - Bart's Room
**Characters:** Bart, Lisa

As Bart prepares to join the outdoor fun, Lisa stops him.

**Lisa:** Reminds Bart that his prayers were answered and he "owes God big." He made a promise.

Bart struggles with temptation. Outside, he can see and hear everyone having fun in the snow.

With genuine effort, Bart forces himself to stay inside and study. He reads his history textbook while the snowball fight rages in the background.

**Thematic Moment:** This scene shows Bart's character growth - choosing responsibility over fun.

### ACT FOUR

#### Scene 16: Test Day - The Exam
**Location:** Springfield Elementary - Mrs. Krabappel's Classroom
**Characters:** Bart, Mrs. Krabappel, Students

He completes the test and turns it in.

#### Scene 17: The Grade - Failure by One Point
**Location:** Mrs. Krabappel's Classroom
**Characters:** Mrs. Krabappel, Bart

Mrs. Krabappel grades Bart's test.

**Mrs. Krabappel:** "It's a 59. That's another F."

Bart is devastated. He scored one point below passing despite genuinely trying his hardest.

**Bart:** (tearfully) "I really tried this time!"

The injustice of it overwhelms him. He studied, he sacrificed his snow day, he actually tried - and he still failed.

Bart breaks down crying at his desk.

#### Scene 18: The Bonus Point
**Location:** Mrs. Krabappel's Classroom
**Characters:** Mrs. Krabappel, Bart

Through his tears, Bart makes a comparison to express how he feels.

**Bart:** References George Washington's surrender at Fort Necessity in 1754, relating his own defeat to Washington's.

Mrs. Krabappel stops. This is an obscure piece of historical knowledge - not from the main curriculum.

**Mrs. Krabappel:** Realizes Bart actually absorbed something during his studying. He learned real history, even if he couldn't express it on the test.

Moved by his genuine effort and this unexpected display of knowledge, she makes a decision.

**Mrs. Krabappel:** Awards Bart one extra point for applied historical knowledge.

59 + 1 = 60. A D-minus. The lowest possible passing grade.

**Bart:** "I passed! I passed!"

Overcome with joy, Bart impulsively kisses Mrs. Krabappel on the lips.

#### Scene 19: Bart's Celebration
**Location:** Springfield Streets, Simpson Home
**Characters:** Bart, Springfield Residents, Simpson Family

**Location:** Springfield Street
**Characters:** Bart

In the midst of his celebration, Bart suddenly stops.

He realizes what he just did - he kissed his teacher on the lips.
