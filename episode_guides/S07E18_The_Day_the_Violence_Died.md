## Synopsis

During a parade celebrating 75 years of Itchy & Scratchy, Bart encounters Chester J. Lampwick, a homeless elderly man who claims to be the true creator of the Itchy character. Chester reveals that Roger Meyers Sr., the supposed founder of Itchy & Scratchy Studios, stole his creation back in 1919. With Chester's only proof - an original nitrate film of "Manhattan Madness" - destroyed by a faulty projector, Bart takes on the challenge of proving Chester's case. With the help of the incompetent lawyer Lionel Hutz and Homer serving as "champerter" (financial backer of the lawsuit), they take on the powerful animation studio. When Bart discovers an original animation cel at the Android's Dungeon with Chester's signature and a 1919 date hidden beneath the frame, the court rules in Chester's favor, awarding him $800 billion in damages. However, this pyrrhic victory bankrupts Itchy & Scratchy Studios, leaving Bart and Lisa devastated as their favorite cartoon goes off the air. In a twist ending, two kids named Lester and Eliza (resembling the original Tracey Ullman Show designs of Bart and Lisa) save the studio by discovering that Roger Meyers Sr.'s work was also stolen - specifically, the Mr. ZIP postal mascot design - securing a settlement that revives the studio.
