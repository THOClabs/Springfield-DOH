## Synopsis

After the family's television breaks, the Simpsons visit an outlet mall to find a replacement. While Homer purchases a cheap "Panaphonics" TV, Marge discovers a genuine Chanel suit marked down from $2,800 to just $90. Despite her initial hesitation, the family encourages her to buy it for herself. The suit transforms Marge's self-image and opens doors to a world of upper-class society.

At a gas station, Marge runs into Evelyn, a wealthy former high school classmate, who is impressed by Marge's designer outfit and invites the family to visit the exclusive Springfield Country Club. Marge becomes obsessed with fitting in among the wealthy members, constantly altering and re-sewing her Chanel suit to create new looks for each visit. Meanwhile, Homer discovers he has natural golfing talent and is challenged to a match by Mr. Burns, who sees him as a potential partner.

During the golf match, Homer witnesses Smithers cheating for Mr. Burns by secretly replacing Burns' poorly hit balls with ones placed favorably on the green. Burns, realizing Homer knows his secret, offers the Simpsons full country club membership in exchange for his silence. Marge is thrilled at the prospect of permanent acceptance into high society.

However, when Marge's suit finally falls apart beyond repair, she spends $3,300 on a new designer dress for the membership initiation ball. At the event, Marge realizes she has been neglecting her family and changing herself to please others. In a moment of clarity, she confesses to her family about the expensive dress and decides they should leave the country club. The Simpsons happily return to Krusty Burger, embracing their authentic selves over hollow social climbing.
