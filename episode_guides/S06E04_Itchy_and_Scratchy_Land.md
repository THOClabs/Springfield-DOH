## Synopsis

Bart and Lisa convince their parents to skip the planned family vacation to a bird sanctuary in favor of visiting Itchy & Scratchy Land, a new theme park based on the violent cartoon. Marge is persuaded when she learns the park has adult amenities including bars, bowling alleys, and a parents' relaxation center. At the park, Bart and Homer get into trouble by launching a stink bomb and kicking a costumed actor, landing them in the park's jail. When a calculation error by Professor Frink causes the animatronic Itchy and Scratchy robots to malfunction and turn on the guests, the Simpson family must fight for survival. They discover the robots' weakness - camera flashes - and use their vacation photos to defeat the mechanical menace, becoming unlikely heroes.
