## Synopsis

After neglecting Grampa at a family event due to their obsession with a new hot tub, the Simpsons travel to Ireland to fulfill his lifelong dream of revisiting O'Flanagan's Pub in Dunkilderry. Upon arrival, they discover modern Ireland has become commercialized and tech-focused, with the once-thriving pub now abandoned. Homer and Grampa accidentally purchase the pub and attempt to revive it, eventually turning it into a "smoke-easy" (exploiting Ireland's indoor smoking ban). The business thrives until authorities shut them down, resulting in deportation and a small fine.
