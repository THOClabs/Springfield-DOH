## Synopsis

The Season 7 premiere resolves the cliffhanger mystery of who shot Mr. Burns. The episode opens with Springfield reeling from the shooting at the town hall sundial. Smithers, wracked with guilt and fragmented memories, confesses to the crime—but he's proven innocent when Sideshow Mel establishes he was home watching "Pardon My Zinger" at the time. Suspicion shifts to Homer Simpson when a gun with his fingerprints and Simpson family DNA is found in the family car. Homer is arrested and escapes from a prison transport, becoming a fugitive in a parody of "The Fugitive." Lisa investigates independently while Chief Wiggum experiences bizarre Twin Peaks-inspired dreams. The truth is finally revealed when Burns regains consciousness: the shooter was baby Maggie Simpson, who accidentally discharged Burns' gun during a struggle over her lollipop. In a chilling final moment, Maggie's eyes shift suspiciously after Marge claims it was an accident.

**Location:** Dream Sequence / 1960s Setting

Smithers dreams he's in a 1960s cop show called "Speedway Squad." The dream has a psychedelic, retro quality.

**Smithers:** "Did I... did I do it?"

#### Scene 2: Burns is Alive
**Location:** Springfield Hospital / Smithers' Apartment
**Characters:** Smithers, Mr. Burns (briefly)

Smithers discovers that Burns wasn't killed—he's alive but comatose in the hospital. This brings relief but also confusion about his own involvement.

**Smithers:** "He's alive? But then... what did I do?"

#### Scene 3: Kent Brockman's News Report

Kent Brockman provides an update on the shooting investigation.

#### Scene 4: The Investigation Begins
**Location:** Springfield Police Station
**Characters:** Chief Wiggum, Lou, Eddie

Chief Wiggum leads the investigation with his characteristic incompetence.

**Wiggum:** "Alright, boys. We've got a long list of suspects. Pretty much everyone in town wanted Burns dead."

**Wiggum:** "Which is why we'll narrow it down... scientifically."

#### Scene 5: Questioning Witnesses
**Location:** Simpson Home
**Characters:** Lou, Maggie, Santa's Little Helper

Lou attempts to question the only witnesses to Burns' final moments before the shooting—Maggie Simpson and Santa's Little Helper.

The police work through their suspect list:

**Groundskeeper Willie:**
**Wiggum:** "Where were you at 3 PM?"
**Willie:** "I was in me shack! And even if I wanted to shoot Burns, me arthritis makes it impossible to pull a trigger!"

**Moe Szyslak:**
**Wiggum:** "Take a lie detector test."
Moe is hooked up to the machine.
**Moe:** "I didn't shoot Burns."
The machine indicates he's telling the truth.

Just as Smithers is about to be convicted, Sideshow Mel interjects.

**Smithers:** "That's true! I was watching at home!"

**Wiggum:** "Can you prove it?"

They check TV listings. Smithers is exonerated.

**Smithers:** "Then who did I shoot?"

#### Scene 9: Tito Puente's Song
**Location:** Springfield Park / Performance Stage
**Characters:** Tito Puente, His Latin Jazz Ensemble, Crowd

Tito Puente, who lost his music teaching job because of Burns, performs a song expressing his rage.

#### Scene 11: The Gun is Found
**Location:** Simpson Family Car
**Characters:** Police, Simpsons

Police search the Simpson car and find the gun with Homer's fingerprints.

**Wiggum:** "Homer Simpson, you're under arrest for the attempted murder of Montgomery Burns!"

In a parody of Twin Peaks, Wiggum has a surreal dream with jazz music and cryptic imagery.

Playing cards catch fire. Wiggum wakes up confused.

**Wiggum:** "What does it mean?!"

---

### ACT FOUR

#### Scene 14: Lisa's Investigation
**Location:** Various Springfield Locations
**Characters:** Lisa, Bart

Lisa refuses to believe her father is guilty and investigates independently.

**Lisa:** "Think about it, Bart. Dad had motive, but so did everyone. There has to be something we're missing."

**Bart:** "Like what?"

**Lisa:** "Like what really happened before the shooting."

She reviews the evidence, focusing on the gun and the Simpson car.

#### Scene 15: Burns Awakens
**Location:** Springfield Hospital
**Characters:** Mr. Burns, Smithers, Wiggum, Simpson Family, Medical Staff

Burns finally regains consciousness. Everyone gathers to hear who shot him.

**Wiggum:** "Mr. Burns, who shot you?"

Burns struggles to speak, his memory returning in fragments.

**Burns:** "I... I remember now. After the town hall meeting... I saw something in a car."

#### Scene 16: The Truth Revealed
**Location:** Springfield Hospital (Continued)
**Characters:** Mr. Burns, Simpson Family, Wiggum, Crowd

Burns recounts what happened:

**Burns:** "I was walking past a car when I saw... a baby. She had a lollipop. I thought, 'I've always wanted to take candy from a baby.' How hard could it be?"

Flashback: Burns approaches the Simpson car where Maggie sits with a lollipop.

**Burns:** "But the infant had a strong grip! We struggled. During the struggle, my gun slipped from its holster..."

The gun fell into Maggie's hands and discharged, shooting Burns. He collapsed onto the sundial, his arms forming the letters "M" and "S"—which everyone thought meant initials.

**Burns:** "She shot me! The baby shot me!"

Gasps fill the room.

**Homer:** "So I'm innocent! Ha!"

**Burns:** "I demand this baby be arrested!"

**Wiggum:** "Sorry, Burns. No jury in the world's gonna convict a baby. Maybe Texas."

#### Scene 17: Resolution
**Location:** Springfield Hospital
**Characters:** Simpson Family, Burns, Crowd

The case is closed. Homer is exonerated. The town accepts the bizarre truth.

**Marge:** "Well, it must have been an accident. Maggie's just a baby. Babies don't shoot people intentionally."

The camera holds on Maggie. Her eyes shift suspiciously, implying the shooting may not have been entirely accidental.

**Homer:** "Well, I guess we can put this whole thing behind us and get back to normal."

**Bart:** "Yeah, just another day in Springfield."

The family leaves the hospital together as Burns is left to recover.
