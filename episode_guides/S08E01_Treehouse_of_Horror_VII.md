## Opening Sequence

**Title Card Opening:** Homer attempts to light a jack-o'-lantern in the kitchen. His hand catches fire, and he runs screaming across the screen as the "Treehouse of Horror VII" title card appears.

**Couch Gag:** The Grim Reaper (Death) sits on the couch waiting. When the Simpson family enters, they all drop dead before him. Death then uses Homer's head as a footrest.

## Synopsis

The seventh annual Treehouse of Horror episode presents three tales of terror and satire. In "The Thing and I," Bart discovers he has an evil conjoined twin named Hugo who has been kept locked in the attic. "The Genesis Tub" sees Lisa accidentally create a microscopic civilization that worships her as a god. Finally, "Citizen Kang" satirizes the 1996 presidential election as aliens Kang and Kodos impersonate Bill Clinton and Bob Dole.

This is notably the lone Treehouse of Horror where every single segment ends with its respective protagonist getting screwed over, creating an unusually dark and cynical episode.

## Segment 1: The Thing and I

### Synopsis
When strange noises are heard in the attic, the Simpson children investigate and discover a terrifying family secret: Bart has a conjoined twin brother named Hugo who was separated at birth. The "evil twin" has been kept chained in the attic, surviving on fish heads, and has now escaped with plans to surgically reunite himself with Bart.

### Characters
- **Bart Simpson** - Discovers he has a twin
- **Hugo Simpson II** - Bart's separated conjoined twin
- **Homer Simpson** - Feeds Hugo fish heads; tries to recapture him
- **Marge Simpson** - Kept the secret for years
- **Lisa Simpson** - Notes "conjoined twins" is more politically correct
- **Dr. Julius Hibbert** - Reveals the truth about the twins

### Scene Breakdown

**Scene 1: Strange Noises**
The Simpson children hear mysterious scratching and eating sounds coming from the attic at night. When they ask Homer about it, he deflects.

**Homer:** "Attic? Oh, that's silly. Seriously though, don't ever go up there."

**Scene 2: Homer's Secret Feeding**
Homer is shown climbing to the attic with a bucket of fish heads, singing to himself.

**Homer:** "Fish heads, fish heads, do doodo doodo..."

The children watch as ravenous eating sounds emanate from above.

**Scene 3: The Revelation**
Dr. Hibbert arrives and explains the truth. When Bart was born, he was a Siamese (conjoined) twin.

**Lisa:** "The term is 'conjoined twins.'"

**Dr. Hibbert:** "The problem was that the left twin was evil. Too crazy for Boys Town, too much of a boy for Crazy Town..."

After separation, Marge and Homer locked Hugo away to protect Bart and society.

**Scene 4: Hugo Escapes**
Hugo breaks free from his chains and terrorizes the house. He captures Bart and prepares for surgery.

**Bart:** "You're crazy!"

**Hugo:** "Am I? Well, perhaps we're all a little crazy. I know I am."

Hugo reveals his plan to surgically rejoin them as "Siamese twins, once again."

**Scene 5: The Twist Ending**
Dr. Hibbert examines Hugo's scar placement and makes a shocking discovery.

**Dr. Hibbert:** "Wait a minute... the scar is on the wrong side. That means the evil twin is and always has been... Bart."

Hugo is welcomed into the family while Bart is locked in the attic to eat fish heads.

**Marge:** (flashback, upon newborn Bart biting Hugo) "I think I'll bottle-feed that one."

## Segment 3: Citizen Kang
