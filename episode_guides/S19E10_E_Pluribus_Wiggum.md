## Plot Summary

Homer Simpson's careless disposal of a leaky battery at a fast-food restaurant causes a massive explosion that destroys Springfield's entire fast-food district, including parodies of beloved chains like Kentucky Fried Panda, Dead Lobster, and Trader Earth's. Devastated by the loss and desperate for funding to rebuild "Fast Food Boulevard," Mayor Quimby proposes holding a special election to raise money for reconstruction.

Since the next regular election isn't until June, Quimby decides to move Springfield's primary election up to the following Saturday. This scheduling change inadvertently makes Springfield the first city in the nation to hold a presidential primary for the 2008 election, catapulting the small town into the national spotlight.

As news spreads, politicians and political journalists from across the country descend upon Springfield, transforming the quiet town into a media circus. Presidential candidates campaign aggressively, and cable news pundits debate endlessly on shows like "HeadButt" (featuring parodies of Arianna Huffington and George Will, voiced by guest stars Jon Stewart and Dan Rather).

Eventually growing weary of the constant political intrusion and media frenzy, the citizens of Springfield hatch a plan to drive out the unwanted attention. They decide to elect the most ridiculous candidate possible, believing that choosing someone absurd will embarrass the political establishment and make them leave town. The consensus choice: local second-grader Ralph Wiggum, son of Police Chief Clancy Wiggum.

To everyone's shock, Ralph wins the Springfield primary, immediately becoming a serious contender in the national presidential race. Homer and Bart enthusiastically embrace Ralph's candidacy, while Lisa is horrified, knowing firsthand just how unintelligent Ralph truly is.

Both the Democratic and Republican parties desperately vie to claim Ralph as their nominee, leading to party officials literally breaking into the Wiggum home and fighting over him. Ralph refuses to declare a party affiliation, insisting that both sides should work together.

Lisa, concerned about Ralph being exploited by the political machine and worried about the implications of his potential presidency, visits the Wiggum house to convince him to drop out of the race. However, Ralph surprises her with an unexpectedly thoughtful explanation: he hasn't chosen a party because he wants Democrats and Republicans to cooperate. Using simple, eight-year-old language, he advocates for diplomacy over military force to resolve conflicts.

Ralph proves to be a formidable candidate, and both major parties ultimately endorse him. The episode concludes with a political advertisement for Ralph Wiggum, jointly sponsored by both the Democratic and Republican parties.

## Cultural References and Parodies

**Episode Title:** "E Pluribus Wiggum" is a play on "E pluribus unum," Latin for "out of many, one" - one of the traditional mottos of the United States that appears on U.S. currency.

**Political Figures:**
- Arianna Huffington is parodied as a pundit on "HeadButt," with a storyline revealing that the flamboyantly gay Julio is her ex-husband (a reference to her real ex-husband Mike Huffington, who came out as gay after their divorce).
- Hillary Clinton and Bill Clinton appear, with Bill asking what he did to deserve being forced to campaign for Hillary's 2008 presidential bid - the answer being the Monica Lewinsky scandal.
- Real political figures parodied include Dennis Kucinich and Fred Thompson.

**Restaurant Parodies:**
- Kentucky Fried Panda (KFC)
- Dead Lobster (Red Lobster)
- Trader Earth's (Trader Joe's)
- Fast Food Boulevard features parodies of Wienerschnitzel's "The Delicious One" mascot and McDonald's "Mayor McCheese"

**Music:** During Homer's farewell tour of the fast-food restaurants, "Hungry Like the Wolf" by Duran Duran plays in the background.

**Film Reference:** The scene where a New Hampshire woman decides to shoot a cashier after her husband carelessly reveals her name is a reference to the classic Western film "Once Upon a Time in the West."

**Pop Culture:**
- Ralph mentions Elmo from Sesame Street
- The couch gag parodies the Bayeux Tapestry, with the Simpsons going to war with Flanders over the couch
- Dan Rather's exclamation "Sweet mother of Murrow!" references legendary journalist Edward R. Murrow

**Inside Joke:** The fictional cigar brand "Jerk-Ass Homer Cigars" references a term coined by Simpsons fans to describe Homer's personality shift during Mike Scully's tenure as showrunner, when the character became meaner and less sympathetic.

**Political Commentary:** The episode satirizes the American primary system, media coverage of elections, political party polarization, and the absurdity of modern campaign politics.

## Memorable Quotes

"Sweet mother of Murrow!" - Dan Rather

"I could really go for some kind of military dictator, like Juan Perón. When he 'disappeared' you, you stayed 'disappeared'!" - Carl (this line caused controversy in Argentina)

"I haven't chosen a party because I want the Democrats and Republicans to work together." - Ralph Wiggum

Ralph's campaign slogan and various Ralph-isms delivered throughout his candidacy showcase his signature confused yet oddly profound statements.

## Production Notes

**Production Context:** The episode was written and produced during the early stages of the actual 2008 U.S. presidential primaries, which featured a crowded Democratic field including Barack Obama, Hillary Clinton, John Edwards, and Bill Richardson, alongside Republican contenders.

**Animation:** Film Roman handled the animation for this episode, using traditional hand-drawn cels that were digitized for broadcast - standard practice for Season 19.

**Direction:** Director Mike Frank Polcino emphasized fluid physical comedy in Ralph's sequences, particularly his bumbling rally appearances and interactions with Secret Service agents.

**Voice Acting:** Nancy Cartwright voiced Ralph Wiggum with her characteristic high-pitched, halting delivery and improvised several ad-libs that heightened the absurdity of his campaign speeches.

**Inside Joke Origin:** The "Jerk-Ass Homer Cigars" joke was pitched by showrunner Al Jean as a self-aware reference to fan criticism of Homer's character evolution.

**Couch Gag:** The Bayeux Tapestry parody was animated in a medieval art style, showing the Simpsons and Flanders engaging in medieval warfare over possession of the couch.

## Reception and Reviews

**Viewership:** An estimated 8.2 million viewers watched the original broadcast, solid numbers for Season 19.

**Critical Response:**

**Entertainment Weekly** gave positive reviews, with writer Dan Snierson noting that Ralph Wiggum had their vote. The episode's timely political satire was praised.

**IGN (6/10):** The reviewer appreciated all the ingredients for a classic episode - Homer's obsession with Fast Food Boulevard, the political satire, and centering Ralph as the focus. However, they felt the episode "seemed to shun Ralph until the end," as the title character doesn't appear until 14 minutes into the episode.

**TV Squad:** Richard Keller praised the episode for its many jokes and sight gags, particularly enjoying the guest stars and numerous pop culture references. His only criticism was the abrupt ending.

**Mixed User Reviews:** IMDb user reviews were mixed to negative, with some viewers appreciating the political commentary but finding it "wishy-washy" and ultimately not funny. Others felt Jon Stewart's cameo wasn't effectively used and criticized Ralph's late appearance despite being the episode's namesake.

**Awards:** Writer Michael Price was nominated for the Writers Guild of America Award for Television: Animation at the 61st Writers Guild of America Awards, recognizing the quality of his script.

## Controversies

**Argentina Ban:** The episode was initially banned in Argentina and most Latin American countries (except Colombia, Mexico, Chile, and Venezuela) due to Carl's joke about Juan Perón making political dissidents "disappear" and confusing Madonna with Perón's wife, Eva (Evita). The reference was considered insensitive given Argentina's Dirty War (1976-1983), during which approximately 30,000 Argentines were "disappeared" by the military dictatorship.

Fox Latin America made the decision not to air the episode, and it remained banned in Argentina until 2013, when an edited version was broadcast. The unedited version didn't air until 2016, after the end of the Kirchner presidential era.

The controversy highlights the challenges of political satire in international markets, particularly when referencing sensitive historical events involving human rights abuses.

## Legacy and Impact

"E. Pluribus Wiggum" stands as a notable political satire episode from The Simpsons' nineteenth season, tackling the absurdities of the American electoral process during an actual election year. While reception was mixed, the episode's central joke - that an incompetent child could become a viable presidential candidate if he refused to align with either party - proved to be surprisingly prescient commentary on American political dysfunction.

The episode's WGA Award nomination acknowledged the sharp political writing, even as some critics felt the execution didn't fully live up to the concept's potential. The international controversy surrounding the Argentina ban demonstrates how The Simpsons' political humor doesn't always translate across cultural and historical contexts.

For Ralph Wiggum fans, this episode represents one of his most significant starring roles, showing that beneath his usual nonsensical utterances lies an occasional spark of unexpected wisdom - or at least, the appearance of it. The episode's final message about bipartisanship and cooperation remains relevant, even if delivered through the most unlikely messenger imaginable.
