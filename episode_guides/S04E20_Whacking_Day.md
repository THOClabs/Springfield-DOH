## Synopsis

Springfield celebrates "Whacking Day," an annual tradition where citizens drive snakes into the town square and beat them to death with clubs. While most of the town eagerly participates, Lisa is horrified by the cruel practice and campaigns to stop it. Meanwhile, Bart is expelled from school by Principal Skinner just before Superintendent Chalmers' visit and discovers that the town's founder, Jebediah Springfield, invented Whacking Day as an excuse to beat up the Irish. Lisa recruits Barry White to help save the snakes, using his deep bass voice to lure them away from the town square to safety. The episode ends with Lisa victorious, the snakes saved, and the town shamed into abandoning the barbaric tradition.
