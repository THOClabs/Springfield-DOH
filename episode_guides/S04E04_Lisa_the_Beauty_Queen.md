## Synopsis

After a caricaturist at the school carnival draws an unflattering portrait of Lisa, she sinks into depression about her appearance. To boost her confidence, Homer sells his prized Duff Blimp ride (won in a raffle) to pay for Lisa's entry into the Little Miss Springfield beauty pageant. Lisa loses to competitor Amber Dempsey but inherits the crown when Amber is struck by lightning. As Little Miss Springfield, Lisa must serve as spokesperson for pageant sponsor Laramie Cigarettes, but she uses her platform to fight social injustice instead. When she protests tobacco marketing to children, the pageant officials strip her of the title on a technicality - Homer wrote "OK" in a space marked "do not write."
