## Synopsis

Bart begins receiving anonymous death threats written in blood. The culprit is revealed to be Sideshow Bob, who has been paroled from prison and is obsessed with killing Bart for repeatedly foiling his schemes. When Bob's stalking intensifies, the FBI places the Simpson family in the Witness Protection Program, relocating them to a houseboat on Terror Lake under the new identity "The Thompsons." However, Bob has strapped himself under the family's car and followed them. In a climactic confrontation on the houseboat, Bob corners Bart with a knife, but Bart stalls him by requesting that Bob perform the entire score of Gilbert and Sullivan's "H.M.S. Pinafore." Bob's lengthy performance gives the houseboat time to drift into Springfield, where Chief Wiggum arrests him. This episode is widely considered one of the greatest Simpsons episodes ever made.

## The Rake Gag

One of television's most famous comedy sequences:

- Bob steps on a rake: *WHACK* "NGGHHHH!"
- Takes a step, another rake: *WHACK* "NGGHHHH!"
- Another step, another rake: *WHACK* "NGGHHHH!"
- Continues for approximately 9 rakes
- The extended duration transforms it from simple slapstick to absurdist comedy
- The groan sound became iconic

---

## Gilbert and Sullivan - H.M.S. Pinafore

The operetta Bob performs includes:
- "I Am the Captain of the Pinafore"
- "I'm Called Little Buttercup"
- "A British Tar"
- "He Is an Englishman"
- And more of the complete score

Bob's theatrical performance demonstrates Kelsey Grammer's vocal talents.
