## Synopsis

Homer fakes his own death using a dummy to avoid Saturday highway cleanup duty for Mr. Burns. When his "death" makes the news, it draws his long-lost mother, Mona Simpson, out of hiding. Homer discovers she's alive when he visits his mother's grave and finds her there, having seen news of his supposed death. After 27 years of separation, mother and son reunite, but Mona's past as a 1960s radical activist who sabotaged Mr. Burns' germ warfare laboratory catches up with her. When Burns recognizes her at the post office, the FBI closes in, and Mona must flee again—this time with help from an unexpected ally: Chief Wiggum, whose asthma was cured by the antibiotic bomb Mona helped deploy decades earlier. The episode ends with one of the series' most poignant moments: Homer sitting alone on his car hood, watching the stars as his mother disappears into the night.

Mr. Burns announces that plant employees will "volunteer" for Saturday highway cleanup on a stretch of road he's adopted—Route 401, "The Montgomery Burns Highway."

**Burns:** "You will be expected to work four hours, giving up your Saturday to remove trash from my highway. This is, of course, entirely voluntary. Refusal will result in termination."

**Homer:** "Aww, I can't believe it. My one day off and I gotta spend it picking up garbage!"

**Lenny:** "Yeah, but think of all the useful stuff people throw out of their cars."

**Carl:** "Like last month's pork rinds."

#### Scene 2: Homer's Fake Death
**Location:** Highway Cleanup Site / Waterfall
**Characters:** Homer, Coworkers, Park Ranger

Homer and coworkers clean the highway. Homer spots a waterfall and devises a scheme to escape work—he constructs a crude dummy of himself and pushes it over the falls.

**Homer:** "Hmm... I wonder if anyone would notice if I slipped away."

Homer creates a dummy using a trash bag, his work uniform, and garbage. He pushes it over the waterfall where it's sucked into a turbine and shredded.

**Park Ranger:** "Oh my God! A man just went over the falls!"

**Worker:** "It was Simpson! He's dead!"

Homer sneaks away, pleased with himself.

**Homer:** (hidden, whispering) "Heh heh heh. Suckers."

**Marge:** (angry) "Homer! That's horrible! Do you know what you put us through?"

#### Scene 5: Bureaucratic Problems
**Location:** Simpson Home
**Characters:** Homer, Marge, Electrician

The consequences of being "dead" become apparent—an electrician arrives to cut off power.

**Homer:** "Hey, I'm Homer Simpson! I'm not dead!"

**Electrician:** "That's what they all say. Here's your shutoff notice."

**Homer:** "No, I'm not a ghost! I'm alive! See? I'm breathing!"

**Bureaucrat:** "Hmm. Breathing doesn't prove anything. We'll need your death certificate to undo this."

**Homer:** "But I don't have a death certificate because I'm not dead!"

The bureaucrat pulls up Homer's file and discovers something interesting—his mother's grave is listed as "Walt Whitman's grave." Homer is confused.

**Bureaucrat:** "According to this, your mother is buried in... Walt Whitman's grave? That doesn't seem right."

**Homer:** "My mother? But she's dead. She died when I was a kid."

**Bureaucrat:** "Well, someone made an error. It says here she's in the poet's section of the cemetery."

#### Scene 7: The Cemetery

Homer visits the cemetery to investigate. He finds the grave marked "Mona Simpson" but trips and falls into the open grave.

**Mona:** "What are you doing in my grave?"

**Homer:** "Your grave? But this is my mother's grave!"

**Mona:** "Homer? Is that you?"

**Homer:** "Mom?!"

**Lisa:** "Actually, how would Homer have told you anything? He thought you were dead."

**Mona:** (nervously) "Well, I... I kept tabs on him from afar."

Mona hugs Bart, Lisa, and picks up Maggie.

**Mona:** "I didn't have a choice, Abe. I had to—"

**Grampa:** "Save it! I don't want to hear your excuses!"

We see young Mona watching TV coverage of Super Bowl III. Joe Namath's long hair inspires her.

**Young Mona:** "Look at that man's hair, Abe! It's so free, so rebellious!"

**Young Abe:** "That's Joe Namath! He's a hippie freak! Why can't he get a haircut like a normal person?"

**Mona (V.O.):** "That's when I realized I wanted more from life. I wanted to change the world."

Mona connects with hippie activists at Springfield University who are protesting Mr. Burns' germ warfare laboratory.

**Hippie Leader:** "Burns is developing biological weapons! Germs that could kill millions!"

**Young Mona:** "This is monstrous! We have to stop him!"

The group plans a raid on Burns' lab. They break in at night and release an antibiotic bomb that destroys the dangerous germs.

Mr. Burns confronts the fleeing activists. In the chaos, he falls down, and Mona stops to help him up—a fatal mistake.

**Young Mona:** "Underground. I'll keep moving. But I'll always be watching over Homer."

She takes one last look at young Homer through the window.

**Mona:** "All my care packages. They never reached him."

**Homer:** "You sent me presents? All these years?"

**Mona:** "Every birthday. Every Christmas. I never forgot you, Homer."

As they exit, Mr. Burns happens to be at the post office. He spots Mona and his eyes narrow.
