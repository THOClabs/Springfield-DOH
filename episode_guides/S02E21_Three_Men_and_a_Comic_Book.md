## Synopsis

At a comic book convention, Bart discovers a rare first issue of Radioactive Man priced at $100. Unable to afford it alone, he tries various schemes to raise money, including grueling work for the miserly Mrs. Glick. Eventually, Bart convinces Milhouse and Martin to pool their money and share ownership. But when the three boys spend the night in Bart's treehouse guarding their prize, paranoia and greed tear them apart. As a storm rages, Bart must choose between saving Milhouse or the comic - he chooses his friend, and the comic is destroyed.

Bart works for hours, suffering injuries and exhaustion.

#### Scene 13: The Treasure of the Sierra Madre Homage

**Characters:** Bart, Milhouse, Martin

The thunderstorm hits with full force. Wind and rain lash the treehouse.

#### Scene 15: Bart's Choice
**Location:** Bart's Treehouse
**Characters:** Bart, Milhouse, Martin

Bart faces an impossible choice:
- Grab the comic as it blows toward the door
- Save Milhouse, who is about to fall

**Martin:** (still tied up) Points out that if Bart hadn't tied him up, HE could have saved the comic.

Bart hesitates for one agonizing moment...

Then chooses **Milhouse**.

He grabs his friend's hand and pulls him to safety.

#### Scene 16: The Destruction of Radioactive Man #1
**Location:** Simpson Backyard
**Characters:** Bart, Milhouse, Martin, Santa's Little Helper

The comic flies out of the treehouse and lands in the backyard.

#### Scene 17: The Morning After
**Location:** Simpson Backyard / Treehouse
**Characters:** Bart, Milhouse, Martin

The storm has passed. The three boys sit in the wreckage of their friendship and their comic.

They reflect on what happened:
- Their inability to share led to the comic's destruction
- Greed and paranoia destroyed their friendship temporarily
- In the end, the comic was just paper

Only one panel survives - which becomes a bird's nest.

The boys reconcile, having learned a painful lesson about trust and sharing.
