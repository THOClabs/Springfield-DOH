## Synopsis

When Homer and Marge attend a candy convention, Homer becomes obsessed with stealing a rare Gummi Venus de Milo. After escaping the convention with a Pop Rocks and soda bomb, Homer loses the precious candy. Later, while driving the babysitter Ashley Grant home, Homer spots the Gummi Venus stuck to her pants and innocently grabs it. Ashley misinterprets the gesture as sexual harassment, and Homer's life becomes a nightmare. An angry mob protests outside his home, the tabloid show Rock Bottom airs a heavily edited interview making Homer look like a predator, and Fox airs a TV movie called "Homer S.: Portrait of an Ass-Grabber" starring Dennis Franz. Only Groundskeeper Willie's voyeuristic videotaping habits can provide the evidence to clear Homer's name.
