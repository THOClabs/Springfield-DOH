## Synopsis

When Marge injures herself during a dance class and gets kicked out by flamboyant instructor Chazz Busby, Lisa tries to defend her mother. Busby notices Lisa's posture is perfect for a ballerina and invites her to join his ballet academy. Despite enthusiastic practice, Lisa performs terribly until she accidentally inhales secondhand smoke from a fellow ballerina during a break. Her performance dramatically improves, leading Lisa to realize that secondhand smoke enhances her ballet abilities. She struggles with the moral dilemma of relying on cigarette smoke to excel, even having a dream where her feminist heroes admit they used to smoke. Just as Lisa is about to light her first cigarette, Homer bursts in and stops her, shooting the cigarette with a handgun. Lisa eventually resolves the issue by using nicotine patches for kids. Meanwhile, Homer shows Bart his secret beef jerky-making operation in a hidden room. When a family of raccoons—who bear a striking resemblance to the Simpsons—steals the jerky, Homer follows them to their home and befriends them rather than attacking them. The two storylines converge when Homer and Bart use the raccoons to steal all the cigarettes from the dancers' bags backstage, helping Lisa quit.
