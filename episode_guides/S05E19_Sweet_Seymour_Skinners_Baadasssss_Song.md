## Synopsis

In this landmark 100th episode, Bart accidentally gets Principal Skinner fired when a show-and-tell disaster involving Santa's Little Helper spirals out of control during a surprise inspection. Ned Flanders is hired as the new principal, and Skinner re-enlists in the Army. Bart unexpectedly misses his old nemesis and befriends the unemployed Skinner, taking him to Luigi's restaurant.
