## Synopsis

After Homer humiliates himself and Marge at a dinner party by getting drunk and leering at Maude Flanders' cleavage, Marge signs them up for a marriage counseling retreat at Catfish Lake hosted by Reverend Lovejoy. Homer discovers the lake is home to "General Sherman," a legendary 500-pound catfish, and becomes obsessed with catching it instead of attending the counseling sessions. Meanwhile, Grampa babysits Bart and Lisa, who manipulate him into letting them eat ice cream, smoke cigars, and throw a wild party. Homer ultimately catches General Sherman but releases it back into the lake to prove his love for Marge, while Grampa tricks the kids into cleaning up their mess by pretending to cry.
