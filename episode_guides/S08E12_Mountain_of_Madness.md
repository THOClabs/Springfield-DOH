## Synopsis

When the employees of the Springfield Nuclear Power Plant fail miserably at a fire drill—taking over 15 minutes to evacuate and causing chaos—Mr. Burns decides they need a lesson in teamwork. He organizes a mandatory team-building retreat to Mt. Useful, where employees must hike to a cabin at the summit. The stakes are high: the last team to arrive will be fired. Burns pairs himself with Homer, planning to cheat by using a snowmobile to reach the cabin first. Arriving early, they celebrate with champagne, but the clinking of their glasses triggers a catastrophic avalanche that buries the entire cabin under tons of snow. As hours pass with no rescue in sight, Burns and Homer descend into cabin fever, developing paranoid delusions and eventually attempting to kill each other. Their violent struggle accidentally ignites the cabin's propane tank, launching the building out of the snow and sending it careening down the mountain toward the arriving employees. In a twist, Burns decides no one will be fired after all, having witnessed his workers demonstrate teamwork (by rushing into the rocket-propelled cabin).
