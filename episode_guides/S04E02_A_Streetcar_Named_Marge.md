## Synopsis

Feeling unfulfilled in her domestic life and frustrated by Homer's lack of attention, Marge auditions for a community theater production of "Oh! Streetcar!" - a musical adaptation of Tennessee Williams' "A Streetcar Named Desire." She wins the role of Blanche DuBois, with Ned Flanders cast as the brutish Stanley Kowalski. The production is directed by the flamboyant and demanding Llewellyn Sinclair. Meanwhile, Maggie is enrolled at the Ayn Rand School for Tots, a strict daycare run by Sinclair's equally severe sister, where pacifiers are confiscated. Maggie leads a baby rebellion to reclaim their pacifiers in a subplot parodying "The Great Escape." As Marge channels her real frustrations with Homer into her performance as Blanche, Homer finally attends the show and realizes that the play reflects Marge's feelings about their marriage - and that he's been the Stanley in her life.
