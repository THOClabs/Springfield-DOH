**Location:** Kwik-E-Mart
**Characters:** Bart, Lisa, Apu

Bart and Lisa visit the crime scene. They watch the security footage of the robbery.

They notice key details:

Bart remembers Sideshow Bob saying he had "big shoes to fill." He also recalls that when Homer stepped on the robber's clown shoe, the robber howled in pain.

But in court, Bart noticed Krusty has small feet. The oversized clown shoes were just costume pieces - they wouldn't hurt if stepped on.

To prove his theory, Bart takes a mallet and smashes it down on Sideshow Bob's foot.

Bob howls in pain - the exact same howl Homer heard at the Kwik-E-Mart. His feet are genuinely large, not padded costume pieces.

The police realize they missed all the crucial evidence. Sideshow Bob is arrested on the spot.

#### Scene 13: Sideshow Bob's Confession
