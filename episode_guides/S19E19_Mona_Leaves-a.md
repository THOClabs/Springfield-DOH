## 2. Plot Summary

When the Simpson family returns home from the Springfield Mall, they discover their front door is open. Fearing a burglar, Homer prepares to attack with "The Defender" (a cinder block on a chain), but instead finds his mother, Mona Simpson, baking apple pie in the kitchen. Mona claims she has faked her death to evade the police and is now staying for good, having given up her activist lifestyle.

Homer, still wounded from years of abandonment, refuses to forgive his mother despite her attempts to reconcile. That night, feeling guilty, Homer creates an apology card for Mona, but when he comes downstairs to give it to her, he discovers she has died peacefully in front of the fireplace.

Devastated and guilt-ridden, Homer struggles with grief after Mona's funeral. At the Kwik-E-Mart, he seeks spiritual guidance from Apu (who suggests reincarnation) and Ned (who offers a Christian perspective). The family eventually discovers Mona's video will, which bequeaths: Marge receives a hemp purse, Bart gets a Swiss Army knife, Lisa receives Mona's "rebellious spirit," and Homer is tasked with scattering her ashes at exactly 3:00 PM from the highest point of Springfield Monument Park.

Homer completes the difficult climb and releases the ashes, only to discover they float into a secret missile silo hidden inside the mountain. Homer realizes this was "one last hippie protest" orchestrated by his mother. Inside the facility, he's captured by Mr. Burns, who reveals a plan to launch nuclear waste into the Amazon rainforest.

With the family's help—using all of Mona's bequeathed items—Homer escapes: Bart throws him the Swiss Army knife to cut his bonds, Marge's hemp purse creates marijuana smoke to incapacitate the guards, and Homer uses "The Defender" to break free. While stopping the missile launch, Homer accidentally triggers the self-destruct sequence, destroying the entire facility in what becomes Mona's final victory against environmental destruction.

The episode ends with Homer properly scattering his mother's ashes while a montage plays of happy memories between Homer and Mona from previous episodes, showing young Homer hugging his mother over breakfast.

## 9. Trivia

### Episode Significance:
- **Final Appearance:** This episode marks the final appearance and death of Mona Simpson in the series (until a controversial Season 36 episode suggested otherwise)
- **Most Tragic Episode:** Widely considered the most tragic and emotionally heavy episode in The Simpsons' entire run
- **Mother's Day Tradition:** Started the tradition of Mother's Day-themed episodes airing annually
- **Universal Studios Timing:** Premiered just days before The Simpsons Ride opened at Universal Studios theme parks

### Death Ambiguity:
- The episode never clarifies whether Mona died of natural causes (old age) or took her own life
- It's presented as a possible "Death by Despair" after Homer's rejection
- Homer believes he caused her death by refusing to forgive her
- The peaceful scene suggests natural death, but the timing remains suspicious

### Inheritance Plot Device:
- **Chekhov's Arsenal:** Every single item Mona bequeathed in her will becomes essential to the climax
  - Hemp purse → Creates incapacitating smoke
  - Swiss Army knife → Cuts Homer free
  - Rebellious spirit → Motivates Lisa to steal earrings
  - Diamond earrings → Creates spark to light purse
  - "The Defender" → Breaks through walls
- This is a perfect example of "Plot Tailored to the Party" storytelling

### Production Details:
- **Production Code:** KABF12
- **Third Title Reference:** Third episode title based on the Mona Lisa painting
- **Glenn Close's Appearances:**
  1. "Mother Simpson" (1995)
  2. "My Mother the Carjacker" (2003)
  3. "Mona Leaves-a" (2008)

### Continuity Notes:
- **Swiss Army Knife Continuity Error:** Bart receives a Swiss Army knife from Mona, but he already had one gifted by Homer (stolen from Ernest Borgnine in "Boy-Scoutz 'n the Hood")
- **Globex Connection:** The missile silo design is identical to Hank Scorpio's lair from "You Only Move Twice," suggesting Mr. Burns may have copied the design or purchased similar technology

### Death Episodes in Fox Animation (2007-2008):
- This was the third Fox animated series episode dealing with parental death in this period:
  1. **Family Guy** - "Peter's Two Dads" (2007)
  2. **King of the Hill** - "Death Picks Cotton" (2007)
  3. **The Simpsons** - "Mona Leaves-a" (2008)

### Real-World Connections:
- The Amazon rainforest waste disposal plot reflects real environmental concerns about illegal dumping in developing nations
- Lance Armstrong's cameo was recorded before his 2012 doping scandal
- The hemp/marijuana humor was relatively bold for 2008 network television

### Animation Details:
- Homer's discovery of Mona's death is animated with unusual subtlety—no music, minimal movement
- The final montage uses actual footage from three different episodes spanning 13 years
- The dedication card appears before the credits, which is unusual for The Simpsons

### Behind the Scenes:
- Joel H. Cohen wrote this as one of the more serious episodes of his career on the show
- The cast reportedly found the table read emotionally difficult due to the dedication to crew members' mothers
- Dan Castellaneta (Homer) said recording Homer's grief scenes was challenging given the episode's dedication to his own mother

## 10. Reception

### Viewership and Ratings:
- **Households:** 6.02 million
- **Nielsen Rating:** 2.9
- **Broadcast:** May 11, 2008 (Mother's Day)
- **Performance:** Strong ratings for Season 19, which was experiencing viewership decline overall

### Critical Reception:

**Positive Reviews:**
- **IGN** called it a "decent episode" and specifically praised the scene where Homer discovers Mona has died
- **TV Squad** echoed IGN's sentiments, appreciating the emotional death scene and the tribute montage at the end
- Both outlets commended the episode's emotional resonance and the respectful handling of the character's death
- The final montage of Homer and Mona's memories was universally praised as touching and well-executed

**Mixed Reviews:**
- **FireFox.org** criticized the third act heavily, arguing it should not have existed
- Critics felt the James Bond-style action sequence undermined the emotional weight of the first two acts
- Some reviewers noted that the "You Only Move Twice" episode had already executed the Bond parody better
- The tonal shift from tragic drama to action-comedy was seen as jarring

**Negative Elements Cited:**
- **Mona's Brief Appearance:** Both IGN and TV Squad criticized how little screentime Mona received before dying, feeling her return deserved more development
- **Bait-and-Switch:** Some felt the opening act set up expectations for a reconciliation story that never materialized
- **Tonal Inconsistency:** The shift from intimate family drama to explosive action was polarizing

**Fan Reception:**
- IMDB Rating: **7.0/10** (relatively strong for later-season Simpsons)
- Positive fan review: *"This episode has a great amount of heart, creativity, humor, and an interesting plot. I just love this episode so much and I strongly recommend it to anyone who wants a heartful funny adventure."*
- Many fans appreciated the emotional depth and character-driven storytelling
- Some longtime viewers felt the episode provided proper closure to Mona's character arc
- Others criticized it for killing off a beloved recurring character

### Legacy and Impact:

**Cultural Impact:**
- Established Mother's Day as a recurring theme for Simpsons episodes
- Frequently cited in discussions of The Simpsons' most emotional moments
- The death scene is considered one of the series' most powerful quiet moments

**Controversial Season 36 Development:**
- In Season 36 (2024), an episode depicted Mona in Hell, retroactively complicating this episode's legacy
- Fans criticized the later episode for "ruining" Homer's tragic storyline
- The Season 36 revelation was seen as disrespectful to the emotional weight of "Mona Leaves-a"
- Many viewers consider "Mona Leaves-a" the definitive ending to Mona's story, ignoring later appearances

**Critical Consensus:**
The episode is generally regarded as a well-intentioned and emotionally effective story that suffers from an overextended third act. The first two acts are considered some of the best character work in later-season Simpsons, while the action-heavy climax is seen as unnecessary. The dedication to the mothers of cast members adds genuine poignancy that transcends the fictional story.

### Awards and Nominations:
- No major awards, but the episode is frequently included in lists of "most emotional Simpsons episodes"
- Often cited in retrospectives about The Simpsons' ability to balance comedy and drama

### Modern Perspective:
In retrospect, "Mona Leaves-a" is viewed as one of Season 19's stronger episodes and a touching tribute to mothers, both fictional and real. While not reaching the heights of the show's golden age, it demonstrated that later-season Simpsons could still deliver meaningful emotional storytelling when focused on core family relationships.
