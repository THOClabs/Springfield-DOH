## 2. Plot Synopsis

The Simpson family is freezing in their home because Homer, counting on global warming, didn't pay the heating bill. While searching for items to burn in the fireplace, Bart and Lisa discover a box containing a degree from Springfield University belonging to Marge. This discovery confuses the children, as Marge had told them Bart was conceived right after she and Homer left high school.

Lisa calculates that because Bart is 10 years old and Homer and Marge are in their mid-to-late thirties, Bart must have been born later in their parents' relationship than previously believed. This prompts Homer and Marge to reveal the true story of their relationship in the mid-1990s.

In a flashback to the 1990s, Homer gives up his dreams of becoming a musician and takes a job at his father's laser tag warehouse to support Marge's college education at Springfield University. At the university, Marge becomes impressed with her radical feminist revisionist history professor, Stefane August. Despite Homer's disapproval, Marge quickly develops an admiration for August, and they form a mutual attraction. Professor August manipulates Marge by telling her that Homer is just a simple "townie" who doesn't appreciate her intellect.

Devastated by Marge's wandering eye and feeling inadequate, Homer quits his job and returns to his music. In his anger and despair, he reinvents his R&B group with a new sound called "grunge" (which he explains stands for "Guitar Rock Utilizing Nihilist Grunge Energy"). His band is renamed "Sadgasm," and they quickly gain popularity with songs like "Politically Incorrect" (based on Nirvana's "Frances Farmer Will Have Her Revenge On Seattle" and "Heart Shaped Box").

During one of Sadgasm's concerts at Springfield University, a character named Marvin Cobain calls his cousin Kurt Cobain and tells him about Homer's new sound. Homer's grunge band becomes hugely successful, even catching the attention of "Weird Al" Yankovic, who creates a parody of one of Homer's songs. Homer achieves every rock star's dream: hating being famous.

Meanwhile, Marge continues dating the pretentious Professor August, but their relationship proves hollow and unsatisfying. When Marge sees a special MTV news report with Kurt Loder announcing that Sadgasm has broken up and that Homer is holed up in a mansion, hopelessly addicted to insulin (which he's been using as a drug substitute), she must choose between her new life and her old love.

Realizing where her heart truly belongs, Marge leaves Professor August and returns to Homer. She finds him in his deteriorated state and helps him recover. They reconcile, and the episode ends with Homer and Marge together, explaining to Bart and Lisa that despite the difficult period, their love ultimately prevailed.

## 3. Key Characters

**Homer Simpson:** In the flashback, Homer is portrayed as a struggling musician who sacrifices his dreams to work at his father's laser tag warehouse to support Marge's education. When Marge shows interest in Professor August, Homer returns to music and invents "grunge," becoming a famous but self-destructive rock star before eventually reconciling with Marge.

**Marge Simpson:** A college student at Springfield University in the 1990s who becomes attracted to her pretentious professor, Stefane August. She ultimately realizes that Homer is her true love and returns to him.

**Bart Simpson:** Questions his parents about the discrepancy in the timeline of his birth when he and Lisa discover Marge's college degree.

**Lisa Simpson:** Does the mathematical calculations that reveal the inconsistency in Homer and Marge's relationship timeline, prompting the flashback story.

**Professor Stefane August:** Marge's radical feminist revisionist history professor at Springfield University. Voiced by Hank Azaria, he's portrayed as a smug, pretentious intellectual who manipulates Marge with "quasi-feminist pablum" to pursue a romantic relationship with her. He's described as a "faux-progressive bro who spits quasi-feminist bromides to pick up women."

**Marvin Cobain:** A Springfield University student who witnesses Sadgasm's performance of "Politically Incorrect" and calls his cousin Kurt Cobain to tell him about the new sound, directly parodying the "Marvin Berry calling Chuck Berry" scene from Back to the Future.

**Kurt Loder:** Appears as himself delivering an MTV News breaking report about Sadgasm's breakup and Homer's drug problems, self-referencing his real-life breaking news broadcast about Kurt Cobain's death.

**"Weird Al" Yankovic:** Appears as himself, creating a parody of Homer's grunge music, referencing his real-life parody "Smells Like Nirvana" of Nirvana's "Smells Like Teen Spirit."

**Abraham "Grampa" Simpson:** Owns a laser tag warehouse where Homer works to support Marge's college education.

**Moe Szyslak:** In the 1990s flashback, Moe has converted his bar into a cigar bar, reflecting the 1990s cigar boom.

## 6. Production Notes and Trivia

**Continuity Controversy:**
- The entire purpose of this episode was to update Homer and Marge's backstory from the 1970s (established in the 1991 episode "The Way We Was") to the 1990s, creating a floating timeline
- This was an attempt to address the fact that if Homer and Marge graduated in the mid-1970s and had Bart in the early 1980s (as previously established), they would be in their 50s by 2008
- The episode has become one of the most controversial in the series' history for fundamentally altering established continuity

**Canon Status:**
- Later seasons returned to the original 1970s setting, and the events of this episode were never mentioned again
- The episode was later deemed non-canon as a sign of regret from the production crew
- However, the book "The Simpsons Family History" shows events from this episode as part of the family history, creating further confusion

**Writer Background:**
- Matt Selman, who wrote this episode, has been the current primary showrunner for The Simpsons since season 33

**Guest Star Notes:**
- This was "Weird Al" Yankovic's second appearance on The Simpsons (first was in season 14's "Three Gays of the Condo")

- Voiced by Hank Azaria, who voiced multiple characters in this episode

## 7. Reception and Critical Response

**Critical Reception:**

The episode received overwhelmingly negative reviews from critics and fans, primarily due to its retconning of established Simpsons continuity.

**Robert Canning (IGN) - 3/10:**
- Said the episode "insulted lifelong Simpsons fans everywhere" for changing the continuity of the show
- Although he liked the jokes about the 1990s, he thought it was an "insult" to famous moments of the series

**Richard Keller (TV Squad):**
- Enjoyed the many cultural references to the 1990s
- Felt disappointed that the episode changed the continuity of The Simpsons

**Fan Reactions:**

The episode generated a heavy amount of negative feedback from the fanbase:

- Many fans felt the show had "officially jumped the shark" with this episode
- Some called it "the nail in the coffin" for the series
- Fans found it "bizarre beyond belief to see Homer and Marge being 'grunge kids' when the heyday of The Simpsons was IN the 1990s"
- Critics argued the episode "fundamentally alters the thematic foundation of the series"
- The continuity change was seen as disrespectful to the show's history and iconic earlier episodes

**Defense of the Episode:**

Some viewers defended the episode:

- Felt "the episode turned out pretty well" despite the continuity issues
- Appreciated the 1990s cultural references and parodies

**Overall Impact:**

## 9. Themes and Analysis

**The Floating Timeline:**
- The episode attempts to address one of the central paradoxes of The Simpsons: the characters don't age, but the show is set in the present
- By updating Homer and Marge's backstory from the 1970s to the 1990s, the writers attempted to make the characters' ages more plausible
- However, this created more problems than it solved, as it contradicted beloved earlier episodes

**Nostalgia and Music:**
- The episode explores the grunge movement and 1990s culture
- Homer's journey as a musician mirrors the rise and fall of many grunge artists, particularly Kurt Cobain
- The insulin addiction subplot darkly parodies the drug problems that plagued many 1990s rock stars

**Class and Intellectualism:**
- Professor August represents pretentious pseudo-intellectualism
- The episode critiques "faux-progressive" individuals who use progressive language to manipulate others
- Homer, the "townie," is initially dismissed as intellectually inferior but proves his creativity through music
- Ultimately, genuine emotion (Homer's grunge music and his love for Marge) triumphs over pretentious intellectualism

**Relationship Dynamics:**
- The episode explores the tension between personal growth (Marge's education) and relationship stability
- Marge's attraction to August represents the allure of a different, more "sophisticated" life
- Homer's success as a musician shows that he has depth beyond his "simple townie" image
- The reconciliation affirms that their love is based on genuine connection rather than surface-level compatibility

**Self-Destruction and Redemption:**
- Homer's descent into drug addiction (insulin as a substitute) mirrors the self-destructive tendencies of many successful artists
- The phrase "I had finally achieved every rock star's dream: hating being famous" comments on the dark side of celebrity
- Marge's return to save Homer provides the redemption arc

**Meta-Commentary:**
- The episode is self-aware about its retconning, with characters questioning the timeline
- References to Matt Groening and Futurama break the fourth wall
- The floating timeline concept itself becomes a theme

## 10. Legacy and Impact

**Continuity Crisis:**
- "That '90s Show" remains one of the most controversial episodes in Simpsons history
- The attempted retcon was largely rejected by fans and later abandoned by the show's writers
- Subsequent episodes returned to referencing Homer and Marge's 1970s relationship, effectively making this episode non-canon
- However, contradictions about the timeline continue to this day, with the show occasionally updating references to maintain some contemporary relevance

**Fan Community Impact:**
- The episode is frequently cited in discussions about The Simpsons' decline in quality
- On fan forums like NoHomers.net, it ranks among the worst episodes ever produced
- It became a cautionary tale about respecting established continuity in long-running series
- The phrase "That '90s Show" became shorthand among fans for ill-advised retcons

**Critical Reassessment:**
- Some later analyses have argued that fans criticize the episode for the wrong reasons
- The floating timeline concept has been defended as necessary for a show that has run for 35+ seasons
- The 1990s cultural references and parodies have been praised independently of the continuity issues

**Influence on the Series:**
- The overwhelmingly negative reaction may have influenced the show's approach to continuity in later seasons
- Writers became more cautious about major retcons to established character histories
- The episode demonstrated the passionate attachment fans have to the show's classic era

**Cultural Footnote:**
- Despite being deemed non-canon, the episode remains part of The Simpsons' official episode lineup
- It serves as a time capsule of 2000s-era nostalgia for the 1990s
- The grunge parodies and "Weird Al" appearance are still appreciated by some viewers

**The Floating Timeline Debate:**
- The episode brought attention to the inherent contradiction in The Simpsons' premise
- It sparked ongoing discussions about how long-running animated sitcoms should handle time and continuity
- Shows like Family Guy, American Dad, and Bob's Burgers have faced similar challenges
- The Simpsons has since adopted a more casual approach to continuity, with Homer and Marge's past sometimes referenced as the 1970s, sometimes the 1990s, depending on the needs of individual episodes

**Production Team Reflection:**
- The fact that the production crew later deemed the episode non-canon suggests they recognized the mistake
- However, the publication of "The Simpsons Family History" book featuring this episode's events shows ongoing confusion about its canonical status
- Matt Selman's continued success with the show (becoming showrunner in season 33) suggests the episode didn't harm his career, though it remains a controversial entry in his portfolio

**Enduring Controversy:**
- Nearly two decades after its original broadcast, "That '90s Show" remains a flashpoint in discussions about The Simpsons
- It represents a larger conversation about the challenges of maintaining a show's integrity over multiple decades
- The episode stands as both a failed experiment and an interesting historical artifact of the show's later seasons
