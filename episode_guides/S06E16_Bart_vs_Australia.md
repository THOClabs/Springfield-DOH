## Synopsis

After Lisa explains the Coriolis effect to Bart, he becomes curious whether water really drains differently in the Southern Hemisphere. Bart makes collect calls around the world, eventually reaching a young Australian boy named Tobias Drundridge. The six-hour phone call racks up a $900 bill that Tobias's father refuses to pay, sparking an international incident. The Australian government demands Bart come to Australia to receive punishment - a "booting" (a kick in the rear with a giant boot). The Simpson family travels to Australia as part of a State Department diplomatic mission, but Homer's antics and Bart's refusal to accept punishment lead to a chase through the U.S. Embassy. The family escapes via helicopter, but not before Bart moons the Australian Parliament. In a final twist, a bullfrog Bart brought with him begins overrunning Australia, echoing the country's real invasive species problems.
