## Synopsis

To celebrate Valentine's Day, Homer takes Marge to the Tunnel of Love at a carnival. However, when Bart pulls a prank involving gelatin, pouring it into the ride's waterway, the liquid solidifies and the boats become hopelessly stranded. To pass the time and cheer Marge up, Homer recounts some of the greatest love stories of all time. This anthology episode presents three self-contained romantic tales, each parodying famous love stories: "Bonnie and Clyde" starring Homer and Marge as the Depression-era outlaws, "Shady and the Vamp" featuring Marge telling a canine romance inspired by "Lady and the Tramp," and finally Bart's punk rock tale of "Sid and Nancy" with Lisa as Nancy Spungen and Nelson as Sid Vicious. Each story explores romance through different lenses while the Simpson family remains stuck in the Valentine's Day tunnel, creating a framework for this love-themed trilogy.

**Location:** Tunnel of Love Ride

As Homer and Marge board their boat and enter the tunnel, Bart executes his prank by dumping large quantities of gelatin into the ride's waterway. The gelatin sets, solidifying the water and immobilizing all the boats inside the tunnel.

Trapped and with time to kill, Homer decides to entertain Marge by telling romantic stories.

Ned proves surprisingly willing to participate in the criminal activities.

#### Scene 7: The Cartoon Reference

#### Scene 8: Ned's Moral Turning Point

#### Scene 10: The Final Shootout
**Location:** Rural road
**Characters:** Bonnie (Marge), Clyde (Homer), Police officers

**Clyde:** "The best, Bonnie. The best."

The police keep firing throughout their extended death scene dialogue, creating an absurdist comedy moment. Eventually, they collapse, though they don't bleed or show realistic death.

#### Scene 28: The Beginning of Addiction
**Location:** Various Springfield locations
**Characters:** Nancy (Lisa), Sid (Nelson)

**Characters:** Nancy (Lisa), Sid (Nelson), Otto

Nancy and Sid make half-hearted attempts to quit chocolate, but Otto the dealer keeps reappearing with new supplies.

They repeatedly fall back into their chocolate habit.

#### Scene 32: The Tragic Implication
**Location:** Apartment
**Characters:** Nancy (Lisa), Sid (Nelson)

The segment concludes with a dark implication referencing the real Sid and Nancy's fate, though the actual ending is left ambiguous in typical Simpsons fashion. The tone suggests tragedy while avoiding explicitly showing their demise.

4. **Parental Responsibility:** The Shady and Vamp segment deals with pregnancy, abandonment, and ultimately parental commitment

5. **Rebellion:** Both Bonnie and Clyde and Sid and Nancy celebrate rebellious figures who reject societal norms

6. **Valentine's Day Commercialism:** The frame story gently mocks the commercialization of romance through the carnival Tunnel of Love

8. **Love's Complexity:** Each segment shows that love isn't simple or always healthy - it can be violent, irresponsible, or addictive

---

## Trivia

- **UK Broadcasting Restriction:** This episode was the second Simpsons episode (after "Weekend at Burnsie's") to be broadcast after the 9 PM watershed in the UK and Ireland on Sky1, due to adult content including the violent Bonnie and Clyde death scene and the satirical drug use in the Sid and Nancy segment

- **Language Content:** The repeated use of "bollocks" in the Sid and Nancy segment (a British profanity) was deemed too strong for pre-watershed broadcast in the UK

- **No Guest Stars:** Unlike many Simpsons episodes, "Love, Springfieldian Style" featured no guest voice actors, relying entirely on the regular cast

- **Valentine's Day Timing:** The episode aired on February 17, 2008, just three days after Valentine's Day

- **Animation Styles:** Each segment features different animation aesthetics - the Bonnie and Clyde segment has a period-appropriate look, Shady and the Vamp uses Disney-inspired painted backgrounds, and Sid and Nancy employs a gritty 1970s punk aesthetic

- **Director's Episode:** This was one of Raymond S. Persi's early directing credits on The Simpsons

- **Trilogy Episode Tradition:** This continues The Simpsons' occasional anthology format, though unlike the "Treehouse of Horror" episodes, this anthology aired during regular season

- **Homer Name Connection:** The Shady and the Vamp segment includes an inside joke - "Homer" was actually one of the names considered for the Tramp character in Disney's original "Lady and the Tramp"

- **Historical Accuracy:** The Bonnie and Clyde segment takes liberties with history, including the humorous extended death scene and the Pearl Harbor joke

- **Chocolate Instead of Drugs:** The decision to use chocolate as a drug substitute in the Sid and Nancy segment allowed the show to parody drug culture while maintaining its TV-PG rating

- **Production Code:** KABF04 indicates this was the fourth episode produced for the season's production cycle

---

## Continuity Notes

- **Valentine's Day Episodes:** This adds to The Simpsons' collection of Valentine's Day-themed episodes, exploring romantic relationships through parody

- **Anthology Format:** Follows in the tradition of other Simpsons anthology episodes like "Simpsons Tall Tales" (Season 12) and "Tales from the Public Domain" (Season 13)

- **Homer and Marge's Relationship:** The frame story reinforces Homer and Marge's enduring romance despite Homer's often thoughtless behavior

- **Bart's Pranks:** Bart's gelatin prank is consistent with his character's history of causing chaos

- **Nelson and Lisa Pairing:** The casting of Nelson as Sid to Lisa's Nancy creates an unusual romantic pairing between these characters, though it's purely within the story-within-a-story

- **Animation Experimentation:** The varied animation styles demonstrate the show's continued willingness to experiment with visual presentation

- **No Long-term Impact:** As an anthology episode, there are no continuity implications for the main Simpson universe

---

## Production Notes

- **Writer:** Don Payne, who had written for The Simpsons since 1999, penned this Valentine's Day anthology. Payne passed away in 2013 and also worked on films including "Fantastic Four: Rise of the Silver Surfer" and "Thor"

- **Director:** Raymond S. Persi directed the episode in one of his early helming efforts for the series. Persi later became a story artist on Disney films including "Wreck-It Ralph"

  - Yeardley Smith as Lisa and Nancy Spungen
  - Hank Azaria as Ned Flanders, Chief Wiggum, Otto, Comic Book Guy, and others
  - Harry Shearer as Principal Skinner, Reverend Lovejoy, and other characters

- **Animation Challenges:** The three distinct visual styles required different animation approaches, particularly the Disney-inspired painted backgrounds in the Shady and the Vamp segment

- **Musical Elements:** The "Any Minute Now" musical number in the Shady and the Vamp segment was original composition for the episode

- **Broadcast Standards:** The episode pushed boundaries with its violence (Bonnie and Clyde's extended shooting) and drug parody (chocolate addiction), leading to post-watershed scheduling in some markets

- **Critical Target:** The episode satirizes the romanticization of criminal and self-destructive relationships in film and popular culture
