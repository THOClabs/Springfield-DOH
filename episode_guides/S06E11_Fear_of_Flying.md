## Synopsis

After Homer is banned from Moe's Tavern for participating in a prank, he searches for a new bar. His misadventures lead him to impersonate an airline pilot, resulting in a crashed plane and free airline tickets for the Simpson family as hush money. However, when the family prepares to fly, Marge reveals she has a severe fear of flying. With Lisa's encouragement, Marge begins therapy with Dr. Zweig (Anne Bancroft), who helps her uncover the root cause of her phobia: childhood embarrassment over discovering her father was a flight attendant, not a pilot as she had believed.

The regulars at Moe's Tavern are engaging in a series of increasingly dangerous pranks on Moe.

#### Scene 2: Homer Gets Banned
**Location:** Moe's Tavern
**Characters:** Homer, Moe, bar patrons

Moe discovers Homer's prank and is enraged.

Despite the others pulling far more dangerous pranks, Moe focuses his anger on Homer.

Homer wanders into a lesbian bar.

He doesn't immediately recognize what kind of establishment it is.

**Homer:** "Wait a minute... there's something bothering me about this place."

He exits, still oblivious.

#### Scene 6: The Pilots' Bar

To gain entry, he impersonates a pilot.

He's welcomed and enjoys the camaraderie.

#### Scene 7: Mistaken for a Real Pilot
**Location:** Airport / Airplane cockpit
**Characters:** Homer, airline staff, passengers

Homer's disguise works too well.

He's mistaken for an actual pilot and assigned to fly a plane to Chicago.

He promptly crashes it.

Marge has a severe case of aviophobia (fear of flying).

#### Scene 11: Homer's "Help"
**Location:** 742 Evergreen Terrace
**Characters:** Homer, Marge

Homer tries to help Marge overcome her fear.

His approach: show her airplane disaster movies.

She went to visit him at work one day.

He was a flight attendant.

This revelation caused profound childhood embarrassment for Marge.

The shame became subconsciously associated with airplanes, creating her phobia.

Dr. Zweig's therapy has been successful.
