## Synopsis

Smithers is overworked and on the verge of a breakdown, prompting Mr. Burns to insist he take a vacation. Needing to find a replacement who won't outshine him, Smithers searches for the most incompetent employee and settles on Homer Simpson. Homer struggles in the role and is constantly criticized by Burns, until he snaps and punches Burns in the face. Terrified of Homer, Burns begins doing everything himself and discovers he enjoys self-sufficiency. When Smithers returns, Burns fires him because he no longer needs an assistant. Homer and Smithers team up to make Burns dependent again by having his elderly mother call to harass him, but the plan fails. During a fight between Homer and Smithers, they accidentally knock Burns out a window. After physical therapy, Burns becomes completely dependent on Smithers again, restoring their relationship.
