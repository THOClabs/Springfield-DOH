## Synopsis

While browsing at a Springfield swap meet, the Simpson family discovers an old vinyl record featuring Homer as a member of a barbershop quartet called The Be Sharps. Homer recounts the story of his brief musical career in 1985, when he, Apu, Principal Skinner, and originally Chief Wiggum formed a singing group at Moe's Tavern. After their manager Nigel replaced Wiggum with Barney Gumble, the group achieved massive success with their hit single "Baby on Board." They won a Grammy, performed at the Statue of Liberty centennial, and became international superstars. However, like their obvious inspiration The Beatles, creative tensions and Barney's avant-garde girlfriend (a Yoko Ono parody) led to their breakup. In the present day, the group reunites for an impromptu rooftop concert atop Moe's Tavern, where even George Harrison stops to listen, dismissively remarking "It's been done."
