## Synopsis

When Mr. Burns is fined $3 million for illegally dumping nuclear waste, Springfield holds a town meeting to decide how to spend the windfall. Marge suggests fixing Main Street's potholes, but a smooth-talking con man named Lyle Lanley convinces the townspeople to build a monorail instead. Lanley has sold faulty monorails to other towns (Brockway, Ogdenville, and North Haverbrook), leaving them in ruins. While everyone else is swept up in monorail fever, Marge investigates and discovers Lanley's scheme. She recruits scientist Sebastian Cobb to help stop the runaway monorail before it destroys Springfield.

**Couch Gag:** Citizens of Springfield variant.

---

### ACT ONE

#### Scene 1: The Flintstones Parody Opening
**Location:** Power Plant / Springfield Streets
**Characters:** Homer

The episode opens with a meticulous parody of The Flintstones opening credits.

**Homer:** (singing) "He's the greatest guy in history. From the! Town of Springfield! He's about to hit a chestnut tree!"

Homer slides down a dinosaur's tail (nuclear plant cooling tower) and drives home in Fred Flintstone fashion.

**Production Note:** Director Rich Moore analyzed the original Flintstones intro frame-by-frame on VCR to match timing and camera movements perfectly.

#### Scene 2: Mr. Burns Gets Caught
**Location:** Springfield / EPA Offices
**Characters:** Mr. Burns, Smithers, EPA Agents

Mr. Burns is caught illegally dumping nuclear waste.

He is fined **$3 million** for his environmental crimes.

The money goes to Springfield's general fund.

#### Scene 3: Town Meeting
**Location:** Springfield Town Hall
**Characters:** Mayor Quimby, Marge, townspeople, Lyle Lanley

Springfield holds a town meeting to decide how to spend the $3 million windfall.

**Marge:** Suggests using the money to fix the potholes on Main Street - a practical, sensible solution.

**Lyle Lanley:** A smooth-talking stranger appears and begins his pitch.

He sings "The Monorail Song" - a musical number that converts the entire town.

#### Scene 4: The Monorail Song
**Location:** Town Hall
**Characters:** Lyle Lanley, townspeople, Lisa, Marge

Lanley performs an elaborate musical number modeled after "Ya Got Trouble" from The Music Man.

**Structure:**
- Miss Hoover, Apu, Barney, Grampa, and Chief Wiggum each question his plan
- Lanley rebukes each with a rhyming phrase
- The crowd builds into a frenzy chanting "Monorail!"

**Lisa:** Starts to question him, but Lanley immediately plays to her ego, silencing her criticism.

**Lanley:** "I've sold monorails to Brockway, Ogdenville, and North Haverbrook, and by gum I've put them on the map!"

He unfurls a map of the USA with just those three towns labeled.

**Marge:** Alone in her skepticism - she votes against the monorail but is outnumbered.

---

### ACT TWO

#### Scene 5: Monorail Construction
**Location:** Springfield
**Characters:** Lanley, workers, Homer

Construction begins on Springfield's monorail.

The work is shoddy - Lanley is pocketing most of the money and using substandard materials.

Opossums infest the monorail car.

**Homer:** (about the opossums) "I call the big one Bitey."

#### Scene 6: Conductor Training
**Location:** Monorail Training Center
**Characters:** Lanley, Homer, trainees

Lanley runs a questionable training program for monorail conductors.

He fake-teaches the new conductors (paralleling Harold Hill's fake music lessons in The Music Man).

**Homer:** Is randomly selected as the monorail's official conductor.

Homer has no real qualifications but is thrilled.

#### Scene 7: Marge Finds the Evidence
**Location:** Lanley's Office / Simpson Home
**Characters:** Marge

Marge discovers Lanley's notebook containing his scheme.

The notebook reveals:
- Plans to sabotage the monorail
- Intent to flee with the funds
- Previous failed projects

Marge realizes she must stop him.

#### Scene 8: North Haverbrook
**Location:** North Haverbrook (ruined town)
**Characters:** Marge, Sebastian Cobb

Marge drives to North Haverbrook to investigate.

The town is in complete ruins - destroyed by Lanley's faulty monorail.

**Sebastian Cobb:** An engineer who designed North Haverbrook's monorail appears from the wreckage.

**Cobb:** Confirms that ALL of Lanley's monorail projects are scams.

He offers to help Marge prevent Springfield from suffering the same fate.

---

### ACT THREE

#### Scene 9: Maiden Voyage Preparations
**Location:** Springfield Monorail Station
**Characters:** Lanley, Leonard Nimoy, Homer, crowd

The monorail's inaugural run is scheduled with great fanfare.

**Leonard Nimoy:** Arrives as celebrity guest, adding legitimacy to the event.

**Lanley's Escape Plan:** He arranges for Nimoy to distract the crowd while he escapes to Tahiti.

#### Scene 10: The Runaway Monorail
**Location:** Monorail
**Characters:** Homer, Bart, passengers

The maiden voyage begins - and immediately things go wrong.

The monorail accelerates out of control due to its faulty construction.

Homer has no idea how to stop it. The brakes don't work.

The monorail tears through Springfield at high speed.

**Cinematic Style:** Director Rich Moore filmed this sequence with disaster-movie-style coverage and multi-plane animation for dimensional depth.

#### Scene 11: The Solar Eclipse
**Location:** Monorail / Springfield sky
**Characters:** Homer, passengers, Leonard Nimoy

A solar eclipse occurs, blocking the sun.

Since the monorail is solar-powered, it begins to slow down.

**Leonard Nimoy:** "A solar eclipse. The cosmic ballet goes on."

**BUT:** The eclipse only lasts a few seconds. The monorail starts up again before anyone can escape.

The "Weather Saves the Day" trope is subverted.

#### Scene 12: Marge and Cobb Arrive
**Location:** Springfield / Monorail cockpit
**Characters:** Marge, Sebastian Cobb, Homer

Marge arrives with Sebastian Cobb.

**Marge:** "Homer, there's a man here who thinks he can help you!"
**Homer:** "Batman?"
**Marge:** "No, he's a scientist."
**Homer:** "Batman's a scientist."
**Marge:** "It's not Batman!"

Cobb radios Homer with instructions: he needs to find an anchor to stop the train.

#### Scene 13: Homer Saves the Day
**Location:** Monorail
**Characters:** Homer, Bart

Homer searches for an anchor.

**Homer:** Seriously considers using Bart as the anchor.

**Solution:** Homer grabs the giant "M" from the side of the monorail and ties it to a rope.

He throws it out the window (barely remembering at the last second to tie the rope to something inside).

The "M" hooks onto a giant donut sign - Lard Lad Donuts.

The monorail screeches to a halt.

**Homer:** "Donuts. Is there anything they can't do?"

#### Scene 14: Lanley's Fate
**Location:** Airplane
**Characters:** Lyle Lanley, North Haverbrook residents

Lanley boards a plane to Tahiti to escape with his money.

**Unexpected Stopover:** The flight makes an unscheduled stop in North Haverbrook.

The town's residents recognize him and attack in revenge.

Justice is served.

#### Scene 15: Epilogue / Leonard Nimoy's Exit
**Location:** Springfield
**Characters:** Leonard Nimoy, Marge, narrator

Leonard Nimoy mysteriously beams out like a Star Trek transporter - breaking the show's established physics.

**Production Note:** This meta-humor signaled the show's shift toward more surrealist comedy.

**Marge Narrates:** The monorail was the last folly Springfield embarked upon...

**Exception List:**
- The popsicle stick skyscraper
- The 50-foot magnifying glass
- The escalator to nowhere

- **Skepticism vs. enthusiasm** - Marge's caution ignored
- **Infrastructure scams** - Satirizing real civic boondoggles
- **Disaster movie parody** - Second half parodies Irwin Allen films

## Cultural References

| Reference | Context |

## The Music Man Parallel

The episode directly parodies The Music Man:

| Music Man Element | Simpsons Version |
|-------------------|------------------|
| Harold Hill (con man) | Lyle Lanley |
| River City | Springfield |
| "Ya Got Trouble" song | The Monorail Song |
| Selling band instruments | Selling monorail |
| Skeptical female lead | Marge Simpson |
| Fake teaching | Lanley's conductor training |

**Key Difference:** Unlike Harold Hill, Lanley has NO redeeming qualities. He's pure con man.
