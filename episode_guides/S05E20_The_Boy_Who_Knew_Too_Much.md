## Synopsis

Bart skips school and sneaks into Mayor Quimby's nephew Freddy's birthday party at a country club. There, he witnesses Freddy accidentally injure a French waiter—but it looks like assault. Freddy is put on trial, and the angry mob wants him convicted. Bart is the only witness who knows the truth: it was an accident. However, testifying means admitting he skipped school, which would get him in serious trouble. Meanwhile, Principal Skinner relentlessly hunts Bart across Springfield like a predator, making the stakes even higher. Lisa convinces Bart to do the right thing, and he testifies, saving Freddy from prison but earning himself detention. The episode also features Homer as a stubborn juror who causes a hung jury.
