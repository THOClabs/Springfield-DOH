## Scene-by-Scene Breakdown

### Opening Sequence

**Chalkboard Gag:** "Mud is not one of the 4 food groups"
**Couch Gag:** Standard family couch gag

---

### ACT ONE

#### Scene 1: Lisa's Dental Visit
**Location:** Dentist's Office
**Characters:** Lisa, Marge, Homer, Dr. Wolfe

Lisa visits the dentist. Dr. Wolfe delivers the news: Lisa needs braces.

Marge is worried about the cost. Homer reassures her that the plant's dental plan will cover everything.

#### Scene 2: Union Meeting
**Location:** Springfield Nuclear Power Plant - Union Hall
**Characters:** Homer, Carl, Lenny, union members, previous president

The plant's union holds a meeting. The previous union president mysteriously disappears (implied to be Burns' doing).

The new contract proposal is presented: workers must give up their dental plan in exchange for a free keg of beer at union meetings.

Most workers seem ready to accept.

#### Scene 3: THE DENTAL PLAN EPIPHANY

**THE ICONIC "DENTAL PLAN / LISA NEEDS BRACES" SEQUENCE:**

As Lenny announces the dental plan is being eliminated, Homer's brain begins processing:

*Lenny:* "Dental plan!"
*Marge's voice (in Homer's head):* "Lisa needs braces!"
*Lenny:* "Dental plan!"
*Marge's voice:* "Lisa needs braces!"

This repeats over and over as Homer slowly makes the connection. A pencil floating in his butt crack (from a previous gag) eventually snaps him out of it.

**Homer:** "If we give up our dental plan... I'll have to pay for Lisa's braces!"

This sequence is one of the most quoted moments in Simpsons history.

#### Scene 4: Homer Elected President
**Location:** Union Hall
**Characters:** Homer, workers

Homer speaks up against giving up the dental plan. He reminds workers how the plan has helped them all.

His impassioned (if accidental) speech rallies the workers.

Homer is promptly elected the new union president.

---

### ACT TWO

#### Scene 5: Burns Takes Notice
**Location:** Mr. Burns' Office
**Characters:** Mr. Burns, Smithers

Mr. Burns learns that a new union president is causing trouble. He doesn't recognize Homer despite their many previous encounters.

Burns is intrigued by this "mysterious" labor leader. He decides to invite Homer to negotiate personally.

#### Scene 6: The Negotiation
**Location:** Burns Manor
**Characters:** Homer, Mr. Burns, Smithers

Burns invites Homer to his mansion for negotiations. He attempts various tactics:
- Intimidation
- Bribery (offering Homer gifts)
- Showing him the "big picture"

Homer, being Homer, misinterprets everything. When Burns makes veiled offers, Homer thinks Burns is making inappropriate advances.

**Homer:** "Sorry, Mr. Burns, but I don't go in for these backdoor shenanigans. Sure, I'm flattered, maybe even a little curious, but the answer is no!"

Burns is baffled but impressed by what he perceives as Homer's steely negotiating tactics.

#### Scene 7: Lisa's Outdated Braces
**Location:** Dentist's Office
**Characters:** Lisa, Dr. Wolfe

Without insurance, Lisa can only afford outdated, medieval-looking braces. They're enormous and humiliating.

Lisa is devastated. She looks like a monster.

This raises the stakes - Homer MUST win back the dental plan.

---

### ACT THREE

#### Scene 8: The Strike Begins
**Location:** Springfield Nuclear Power Plant
**Characters:** Homer, workers, Burns, Smithers

Negotiations fail. Homer leads the workers out on strike.

They picket outside the plant with signs. Burns watches from his office, furious.

The workers sing labor songs and rally behind Homer.

#### Scene 9: Burns' Counter-Attack
**Location:** Springfield Nuclear Power Plant
**Characters:** Mr. Burns, Smithers

Burns attempts to break the strike:
- He brings in replacement workers (who are incompetent)
- He tries to turn off the town's power
- He appears on TV to turn public opinion against the strikers

**Burns:** "Who is that firebrand, Smithers?"
**Smithers:** "That's Homer Simpson, sir."
**Burns:** "Simpson, eh?"

Burns STILL doesn't remember Homer from their many previous encounters.

#### Scene 10: Lisa's Fantasy/Dream
**Location:** Lisa's imagination
**Characters:** Lisa (with braces)

Lisa has a fantasy/dream sequence about her future with the horrible braces. She imagines being an outcast, her braces becoming increasingly monstrous.

She sings a Beatles-style song about her situation (parodying "Yellow Submarine").

#### Scene 11: Burns Caves
**Location:** Mr. Burns' Office / Plant
**Characters:** Burns, Smithers, Homer

The strike is working. The plant is losing money. The town is furious about power outages.

Burns finally agrees to restore the dental plan.

But there's a condition: Homer must step down as union president.

#### Scene 12: Victory and Resolution
**Location:** Simpson Home / Dentist
**Characters:** Homer, Lisa, Marge, family

Homer accepts Burns' terms. He doesn't care about being union president - he just wanted the dental plan for Lisa.

Lisa gets proper, modern braces. She's still not thrilled about braces, but they're much better than the medieval ones.

The workers have their dental plan back. Homer is a hero, even if he doesn't fully understand why.
