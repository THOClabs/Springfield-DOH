## Synopsis

When Homer is passed over for the "Worker of the Week" award in favor of an inanimate carbon rod, he's devastated. Meanwhile, NASA discovers that their space launch ratings are at an all-time low and decides to send an average "blue-collar slob" into space to boost public interest. After Homer calls to complain about a boring broadcast, NASA recruits both Homer and Barney as astronaut candidates. Under NASA's alcohol ban, Barney excels in training and is selected for the mission - but when he celebrates with champagne (even non-alcoholic), he reverts to his usual state and injures himself. Homer wins by default. In space, Homer's smuggled potato chips and a broken ant farm create chaos that damages the navigation system. Homer accidentally saves the mission by using a carbon rod to seal the hatch. Upon returning to Earth, the media credits the rod - not Homer - as the hero, with headlines reading "In Rod We Trust."
