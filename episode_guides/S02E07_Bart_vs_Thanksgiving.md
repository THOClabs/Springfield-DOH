## Synopsis

On Thanksgiving Day, Lisa creates an elaborate centerpiece honoring famous women including Georgia O'Keeffe, Susan B. Anthony, and Marjory Stoneman Douglas. When Bart brings in the turkey and there's a struggle for table space, the centerpiece accidentally falls into the fireplace and burns. Lisa is devastated, and when Bart refuses to apologize, he's sent to his room without dinner. Angry and stubborn, Bart runs away from home with Santa's Little Helper. His journey takes him through Springfield's darker side - from attempting to steal a pie from Burns Manor (and being chased by hounds) to donating blood plasma for money to eating at a homeless shelter. When Kent Brockman interviews him on live TV, Bart defiantly refuses to apologize. But witnessing the genuine struggles of homeless people changes his perspective. Bart returns home, and in a touching rooftop conversation with Lisa, finally understands and sincerely apologizes for hurting her. The family reunites for a late-night meal of Thanksgiving leftovers.
