## Synopsis

In the second Christmas episode of the series (airing exactly six years after the series premiere "Simpsons Roasting on an Open Fire"), Bart becomes obsessed with the violent video game "Bonestorm" after seeing aggressive TV commercials during a Krusty the Clown Christmas special. When Homer and Marge refuse to buy the expensive game, Bart's friends convince him to shoplift it from the Try-N-Save discount store. Security guard Detective Don Brodka catches Bart in the act and bans him from the store, leaving a threatening message on the Simpsons' answering machine. Bart manages to intercept and erase the message, keeping his crime secret. However, when Marge announces the family will have their Christmas photo taken at Try-N-Save, Bart's world comes crashing down. Brodka spots Bart and publicly exposes his theft to Marge, who is devastated not by the crime itself, but by her realization that Bart isn't the innocent little boy she thought he was. Marge withdraws her maternal affection, treating Bart with cold distance. Desperate to regain his mother's love, Bart works to make amends, ultimately giving Marge a thoughtfully purchased gift that proves he's learned his lesson.
