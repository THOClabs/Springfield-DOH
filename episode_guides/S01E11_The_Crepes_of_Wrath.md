**Characters:** Homer, Bart, Marge

Bart carelessly leaves his skateboard on the stairs. Homer, not seeing it, steps on the skateboard and takes a devastating tumble down the staircase, severely injuring his back.

Homer is in agony. Marge is furious with Bart for his carelessness.

**Marge:** Demands that Bart clean his room as punishment.

#### Scene 2: Bart's Room - The Cherry Bomb Discovery
**Location:** Bart's Bedroom
**Characters:** Bart

While reluctantly cleaning his room as ordered, Bart discovers a cherry bomb hidden among his belongings - a leftover from the previous summer.

**Bart:** "A cherry bomb! I have a weakness for the classics."

Bart pockets the explosive, already scheming about what to do with it.

#### Scene 3: Springfield Elementary - The Bathroom Incident
**Location:** Springfield Elementary School - Boys' Restroom / Girls' Restroom
**Characters:** Bart, Agnes Skinner, Principal Skinner

The next day at school, Bart flushes the cherry bomb down a toilet in the boys' restroom.

The explosion is massive. Water pipes burst, flooding both restrooms. The girls' bathroom is particularly affected - and Principal Skinner's mother, Agnes, happens to be using it at that moment.

Agnes Skinner emerges from the bathroom, completely soaked and furious.

**Notable First:** This marks Agnes Skinner's first appearance in the series. Her voice in this episode differs from later appearances.

#### Scene 4: Principal's Office - The Proposal
**Location:** Springfield Elementary - Principal Skinner's Office
**Characters:** Principal Skinner, Homer, Marge, Bart

Principal Skinner summons Homer and Marge to discuss Bart's behavior. Expulsion is on the table, but Skinner has another idea.

**Principal Skinner:** Explains that the school participates in a foreign exchange program. He proposes sending Bart to France for three months.

Homer is initially skeptical, worried about scams. Marge is concerned about sending her son so far away.

**Principal Skinner:** Assures them this will be good for Bart - learning a new culture, language, and hopefully developing discipline.

The Simpsons agree to the exchange. In return, the Simpson family will host an Albanian exchange student named Adil Hoxha.

#### Scene 5: Airport - Departure and Arrival

The family goes to the airport. Bart departs for France.

Adil Hoxha arrives - a polite, well-mannered Albanian boy.

Homer is immediately impressed by Adil's politeness and maturity, especially compared to Bart.

---

### ACT TWO

#### Scene 6: Rural France - Meeting Cesar and Ugolin
**Location:** French Countryside - Winemaker's Chateau
**Characters:** Bart, Cesar, Ugolin

Bart arrives at a dilapidated chateau in rural France. He meets his host family: Cesar, a greedy winemaker, and his nephew Ugolin.

Their appearance is grotesque - rat-like features and untrustworthy demeanors.

**Cesar:** Immediately confiscates Bart's belongings.

**Ugolin:** "Escape is impossible."

Bart realizes this is not going to be the cultural experience he was promised.

**Visual Note:** On the journey to the chateau, Bart and Ugolin cycle past scenes depicting several famous paintings, including Claude Monet's "Bassin aux nympheas," Vincent van Gogh's "Champ de ble aux corbeaux," Henri Rousseau's "Le reve," and Edouard Manet's "Dejeuner sur l'herbe."

**Cultural Reference:** Cesar and Ugolin are named after characters from the 1986 French films "Jean de Florette" and "Manon des Sources."

#### Scene 7: The Chateau - Slave Labor Begins
**Location:** Cesar and Ugolin's Vineyard/Chateau
**Characters:** Bart, Cesar, Ugolin

Bart's nightmare begins. He is forced into grueling labor:
- Collecting and crushing grapes by foot
- Sleeping on the cold, hard floor
- Barely fed; constantly hungry
- Clothes become increasingly ragged and decrepit

The winemakers exploit him completely, treating him as unpaid labor rather than an exchange student.

#### Scene 8: Simpson Home - The Model Student
**Location:** 742 Evergreen Terrace
**Characters:** Homer, Marge, Lisa, Adil

Meanwhile, in Springfield, Adil proves to be the perfect houseguest.

He is helpful, polite, and eager to please. He helps with chores without being asked. He engages in intelligent conversation.

Homer becomes increasingly attached to Adil, constantly comparing him favorably to Bart.

**Homer:** "We've become a fully functioning family unit."

Lisa debates political issues with Adil, and Homer awkwardly sides with Adil's critique of American capitalism.

#### Scene 9: Springfield Nuclear Power Plant - The Tour
**Location:** Springfield Nuclear Power Plant
**Characters:** Homer, Adil

Homer proudly takes Adil on a tour of the nuclear power plant.

Adil shows intense interest in the plant's operations, asking detailed technical questions. Homer, flattered by the attention, happily explains everything - even classified information.

**Homer:** Completely oblivious to Adil's true motives.

**Adil:** Takes mental notes of everything, especially security protocols and technical specifications.

#### Scene 10: Adil's Bedroom - The Transmission
**Location:** Simpson Home - Adil's Room
**Characters:** Adil

Late at night, Adil reveals his true nature.

Using hidden equipment, he transmits classified nuclear information to an unknown recipient in an unfriendly nation.

Adil is not an exchange student - he is a Communist spy.

### ACT THREE

#### Scene 11: France - The Antifreeze Scheme
**Location:** Cesar and Ugolin's Winery
**Characters:** Bart, Cesar, Ugolin

Two months have passed. Bart, emaciated and exhausted, witnesses Cesar and Ugolin's criminal scheme.

They add antifreeze to their wine to age it more rapidly and increase profits. This practice is illegal and dangerous to consumers.

**Cesar:** (on antifreeze) "Whenever my faith in God is shaken, I think of the miracle of antifreeze. Too much can be poison, but the right amount gives wine just the right kick."

To prove the antifreeze won't immediately harm anyone, they force Bart to drink a small amount.

**Historical Context:** This plot point references the real 1985 Austrian wine scandal, where numerous wine brands were discovered to have been diluted with diethylene glycol, a toxic chemical found in antifreeze.

#### Scene 12: The Village - Bart's Failed Attempt
**Location:** French Village
**Characters:** Bart, French Gendarme

The winemakers send Bart to town to buy more antifreeze.

Bart spots a police officer (gendarme) and desperately tries to explain his situation and the criminal scheme. However, he speaks no French, and the officer speaks no English.

The gendarme, not understanding, simply hands Bart a piece of candy and sends him on his way.

Bart is frustrated and defeated. He has no way to communicate.

#### Scene 13: The Miracle of Language
**Location:** French Village Street
**Characters:** Bart

After eating the candy, Bart mutters his frustrations about not having learned any French during his two months in the country.

To his shock, he realizes he's speaking French fluently.

**Bart:** Expresses amazement in perfect French - "What am I saying?!"

Through immersion, Bart has absorbed the language without realizing it. This is his breakthrough.

#### Scene 14: Reporting the Crime
**Location:** French Village - Police Station
**Characters:** Bart, French Gendarme, Police Officers

Armed with his newfound language skills, Bart returns to the gendarme.

In fluent French, he explains everything: the illegal antifreeze operation, the slave labor, the exploitation.

The police officers listen intently and spring into action.

#### Scene 15: The Arrest
**Location:** Cesar and Ugolin's Chateau
**Characters:** Bart, Cesar, Ugolin, French Police

Police arrive at the chateau and arrest Cesar and Ugolin for:
- Wine tampering with dangerous chemicals
- Child labor exploitation
- Fraud

Bart watches with satisfaction as his tormentors are taken away in handcuffs.

#### Scene 16: Springfield - FBI Raid
**Location:** Simpson Home
**Characters:** Homer, Marge, Lisa, Adil, FBI Agents

Back in Springfield, FBI agents arrive at the Simpson home.

They have been monitoring Adil's transmissions. The polite exchange student is exposed as a foreign spy.

**FBI Agent:** Explains that Adil has been transmitting classified nuclear information.

Homer is stunned and hurt - he had grown to genuinely care for Adil.

Adil is arrested and taken into custody.

#### Scene 17: The Exchange
**Location:** Border/Exchange Point
**Characters:** Adil, American Spy, Officials

Adil is exchanged for an American spy who had been detained in Albania.

The exchange program has ended very differently than anyone expected.

#### Scene 18: French Hero
**Location:** France - Ceremony
**Characters:** Bart, French Officials, Media

In France, Bart is celebrated as a national hero.

He exposed a dangerous criminal operation that could have poisoned countless wine consumers. The French government honors him.

**Bart:** Reflects that he met "one nice French person" - presumably the gendarme who ultimately helped him.

#### Scene 19: Simpson Home - Reunion
**Location:** 742 Evergreen Terrace
**Characters:** Homer, Marge, Bart, Lisa, Maggie

Bart returns home to his family.

Homer realizes that despite Adil's politeness, Bart is his real son and he loves him.

**Homer:** "Don't mess up France the way you messed up your room." (Earlier, on departure)

The family is reunited, and despite the chaos, Homer has gained a new appreciation for Bart.
