## Synopsis

When Krusty the Clown finally attends a thank-you dinner at the Simpson home, he reveals his tragic past: his real name is Herschel Krustofsky, and his father, Rabbi Hyman Krustofsky, disowned him 25 years ago for becoming a clown instead of following the family tradition of becoming a rabbi. Moved by Krusty's pain, Bart and Lisa embark on a mission to reunite father and son using theological arguments and scriptural quotations.
