## Synopsis

When Homer gets both arms stuck in vending machines at work and has to cancel his ballet date with Marge, she instead goes out with neighbor Ruth Powers. The two women bond over a wild night that includes line dancing and minor vandalism. But things take a turn when Ruth reveals she's driving her ex-husband's stolen car - revenge for his failure to pay child support.

Homer reluctantly agrees to attend.

#### Scene 2: Homer's Vending Machine Disaster

At work, Homer reaches into a vending machine to grab a stuck snack. His arm gets trapped inside.

**Location:** Simpson Home
**Characters:** Homer, Bart, Lisa, Maggie, Lionel Hutz

Homer is finally freed from the vending machines. He rushes home to find Marge still out.

The chase ends at the edge of a massive canyon - just like Thelma & Louise.

They survive (barely) thanks to a garbage dump at the bottom.

#### Scene 13: Resolution
**Location:** Various
**Characters:** All main characters

The aftermath:
- Ruth's charges are dismissed (ex-husband's failure to pay support is considered)
