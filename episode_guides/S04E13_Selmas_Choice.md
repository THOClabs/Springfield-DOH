## Synopsis

When Marge's great-aunt Gladys Bouvier dies, the family travels to her funeral. In her video will, Gladys leaves Patty and Selma one piece of advice: don't die alone without experiencing love. This deeply affects Selma, who becomes obsessed with finding a husband and having children. Meanwhile, Bart and Lisa are excited about a promised trip to Duff Gardens, an amusement park. When Homer and Marge get food poisoning from a spoiled hoagie, they can't take the kids, so Selma volunteers, seeing it as practice for motherhood. The trip to Duff Gardens is a disaster - Lisa drinks contaminated water from a ride and hallucinates wildly, Bart causes mayhem, and Selma is overwhelmed. She realizes she's not ready for children and decides instead to get a pet. She adopts Jub-Jub, Gladys's pet iguana.
