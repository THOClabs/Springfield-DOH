## Synopsis

At Springfield Elementary's Grandparents' Day, Grampa Simpson embarrasses Bart with rambling, incoherent stories about inventing the toilet ("terlet") and using made-up words like "dickety." Bart is mortified and distances himself from his grandfather, believing him to be nothing more than a senile old man.

However, when a fellow Springfield Retirement Castle resident dies, Mr. Burns appears at the funeral with a sinister interest. It's revealed that Grampa and Burns are the last two surviving members of the "Flying Hellfish"—a WWII Army unit that established a tontine (a survivor-take-all pact) for a cache of priceless German paintings they recovered during the war.

With only two Hellfish remaining, Burns decides to expedite his inheritance by attempting to murder Grampa. After several assassination attempts fail, Burns hires a professional hitman. Bart, learning of his grandfather's heroic past and the treasure, helps Grampa retrieve the paintings from their underwater hiding place before Burns can claim them.

In the climax, Grampa has a chance to kill Burns but spares him, instead dishonorably discharging him from the Flying Hellfish for conduct unbecoming. The paintings are recovered, but a representative from the State Department arrives to return them to their rightful owner—a German whose family owned them before the Nazis confiscated them. The German, now an elderly baron, gives one painting to a German children's hospital, leaving Grampa with nothing but restored dignity and a renewed bond with his grandson.

**Grampa:** "What're you cackling at, fatty? Too much pie, that's your problem!"

Grampa digresses into claiming he invented the toilet.

**Grampa:** "Now I'd like to digress from my prepared remarks to discuss how I invented the terlet."

The students snicker.

**Grampa:** "Stop your snickering! I spent three years on that terlet!"

Bart, now intrigued by his grandfather's story, asks more questions.

**Bart:** "Hey, Grampa, do you think I could've been a Flying Hellfish?"

Bart is touched—for the first time, Grampa sees potential in him.
