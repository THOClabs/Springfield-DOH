**Location:** Bart's Room
**Characters:** Bart

Bart creates his fake romantic identity: **"Woodrow"** - named after President Woodrow Wilson.

He writes his first letter to Mrs. Krabappel as Woodrow, crafting romantic sentiments.

For inspiration, Bart:
- Borrows lines from Homer's old love letters to Marge
- Watches old romantic movies for material

For the photo, he sends a picture of hockey legend **Gordie Howe**.

**Production Note:** Writers originally wanted to use Johnny Unitas but couldn't get image rights.

**Location:** Simpson Home

Homer agrees to try. He puts the jar on the counter.

#### Scene 10: Homer vs. The Doghouse (Montage)
**Location:** Simpson Backyard
**Characters:** Homer

Montage of Homer's continued doghouse disasters:
- Hammers his thumb
- Steps on nails
- Lumber collapses repeatedly

Each time, Homer starts to curse but the scene cuts away before we hear it.

The swear jar fills up with quarters.

**Homer:** (after stepping on nail) "Fiddle-dee-dee! That will require a tetanus shot. I'm not going to swear, but I am going to KICK THIS DOGHOUSE DOWN!"

#### Scene 11: The Dinner Date
**Location:** Restaurant / Movie Theater
**Characters:** Mrs. Krabappel, Bart

Mrs. Krabappel arranges an in-person dinner meeting with "Woodrow."

She waits at the restaurant, dressed up and hopeful.

Bart, instead of facing her, goes to see a movie.

"Woodrow" never shows up. Mrs. Krabappel is stood up and heartbroken.

#### Scene 12: Bart's Guilt
**Location:** Springfield Elementary / Simpson Home
**Characters:** Bart, Mrs. Krabappel

Bart witnesses Mrs. Krabappel's genuine heartbreak at school.

She's devastated, not just disappointed. "Woodrow" meant everything to her.

Bart realizes his prank has caused real emotional damage.

#### Scene 13: Bart Confesses
**Location:** Simpson Home - Living Room
**Characters:** Bart, Homer, Marge, Lisa

Bart confesses what he did to his family.

Homer and Marge scold him severely.

**Homer's position:** Bart should confess to Mrs. Krabappel and face consequences.

**Marge's position:** The truth would humiliate Edna even more.

**Lisa's suggestion:** Write a farewell letter as Woodrow that gives her closure - saying he must leave but will always love her.

#### Scene 14: Writing the Letter Together
**Location:** Simpson Home - Kitchen
**Characters:** Homer, Marge, Bart, Lisa

The entire family gathers to write Woodrow's final letter to Mrs. Krabappel.

Each family member contributes a line.

**Homer's contribution:** "Dear Baby. Welcome to Dumpsville. Population: You."

This is rejected. They craft something gentler and kinder.

**Production Note:** James L. Brooks specifically pitched this scene of the family working together.

#### Scene 15: Closure
**Location:** Mrs. Krabappel's Apartment
**Characters:** Mrs. Krabappel

Mrs. Krabappel receives Woodrow's farewell letter.

It's kind, loving, and gives her closure. Woodrow must leave, but he'll always treasure their connection.

She's sad but not devastated. She can move on.

#### Scene 16: The Doghouse Resolution
**Location:** Simpson Backyard
**Characters:** Homer, Marge, Santa's Little Helper

Homer has stopped swearing. The jar is full.

**Marge:** Uses the swear jar money to buy a pre-made doghouse (and a six-pack of Duff).

The subplot resolves perfectly: swearing funded the solution to the swearing problem.

## The Subplot's Clever Resolution

Homer's doghouse subplot has a perfectly circular resolution:
1. Homer can't build doghouse → curses
2. Cursing corrupts Todd → swear jar implemented
3. Homer keeps almost-cursing → jar fills with quarters
4. Quarters pay for pre-made doghouse (and beer)
5. Swearing problem → solved the swearing problem
