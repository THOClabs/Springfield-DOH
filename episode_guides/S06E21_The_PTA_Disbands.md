## Synopsis

When a school field trip to Fort Springfield becomes unaffordable due to Principal Skinner's budget cuts, Bart manipulates Mrs. Krabappel into organizing a teachers' strike. While Bart celebrates his freedom from school, Lisa desperately craves the structure of education and builds a perpetual motion machine out of boredom. The PTA brings in unqualified community members as substitute teachers, including Marge for Bart's class. The chaos forces Skinner and Krabappel to negotiate, ultimately agreeing to rent out the school's cloakrooms to the prison system to raise extra money.
