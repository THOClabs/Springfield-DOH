The highly anticipated Itchy & Scratchy: The Movie is about to premiere.

Kent Brockman covers the event, explaining the history of the cartoon duo.

Then he shows "Steamboat Itchy" (1929) - the first Itchy & Scratchy cartoon together, a parody of Disney's "Steamboat Willie."

**Historical Note:** In the cartoon, Itchy (as Mickey Mouse) whistles on a steamboat, then shoots off Scratchy's legs with a Tommy gun and shoves his head in a furnace.

**Location:** 742 Evergreen Terrace
**Characters:** Homer, Marge, Bart

Homer and Marge discover what happened. This is the last straw.
