## Synopsis

When Homer acquires a free trampoline from Krusty and ignores Marge's safety concerns, their marital tension leads Marge to seek help from self-help guru Brad Goodman. At a town seminar, Goodman becomes fascinated with Bart's spontaneous, irreverent attitude and encourages all of Springfield to "be like the boy." The entire town adopts a "Do What You Feel" philosophy, but societal breakdown follows when workers abandon their responsibilities. The inaugural "Do What You Feel Festival" ends in disaster when an ungreased Ferris wheel crashes into the zoo, releasing animals into the streets. The mob blames Bart, but the family ultimately learns that self-improvement requires work, not quick fixes.
