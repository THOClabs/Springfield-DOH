## Synopsis

Lisa creates a documentary about her family for a school project, capturing the Simpsons in all their dysfunctional glory. When the film impresses Principal Skinner and Superintendent Chalmers, they submit it to the prestigious Sundance Film Festival. The family travels to Park City, Utah, excited to see "Capturing the Simpsons" premiere, but they're horrified when the film exposes their worst moments to a packed theater. Homer, Marge, Bart, and Maggie are furious at Lisa for making them look like monsters. However, their anger is quickly forgotten when Nelson's even more devastating documentary about his troubled home life makes the Simpson family dysfunction seem mild by comparison. Meanwhile, Skinner and Chalmers enthusiastically dive into the movie business, forming "Chalmskinn Productions."

- The "400 Blows" homage required careful framing to match Truffaut's iconic ending
