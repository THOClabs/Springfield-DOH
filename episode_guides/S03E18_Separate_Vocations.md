## Synopsis

After taking the Career Aptitude Normalization Test (CANT), Bart and Lisa receive shocking results that turn their worlds upside down. Lisa, who dreams of becoming a professional jazz musician, is told she's best suited to be a homemaker - and worse, a music teacher informs her that her stubby fingers (inherited from Homer) will prevent her from ever becoming a great saxophonist. Bart, meanwhile, is told he's suited to be a police officer. While Lisa spirals into depression and rebellion, Bart thrives in his new role as a hall monitor, embracing authority and discipline for the first time. When Lisa steals the teachers' edition textbooks in an act of rebellion, exposing the faculty's incompetence, it's Bart who takes the fall to protect his sister - and encourages her to never give up on her dreams.
