### ACT ONE (Flashback)

#### Scene 2: Springfield Church - Sunday Service
**Location:** Springfield Church
**Characters:** Homer, Marge, Bart, Lisa, Maggie, Reverend Lovejoy, congregation

Sunday morning. The Simpson family attends church. Before entering, Marge confiscates Bart's headphones.

When Marge isn't looking, Homer swipes the headphones for himself. During the service, Homer secretly listens to a football game.

Homer's team scores. He leaps up shouting: "It's GOOD! It's GOOD!"

The entire congregation stares at him in shock.

**Homer** (recovering): "It's... good to see you all in church."

**Characters:** Homer, Marge, Bart

Bart wants to see "Space Mutants 4" at the movie theater. Marge forbids him from seeing the violent film.

This advice will directly motivate Bart's later actions.

#### Scene 4: Movie Theater

Bart heads to the theater. Outside, he encounters three older kids: Jimbo Jones, Kearney Zzyzwicz, and Dolph Starbeam.

They sneak in but are eventually caught and thrown out by the theater manager.

#### Scene 5: Kwik-E-Mart
**Location:** Kwik-E-Mart
**Characters:** Bart, Jimbo, Kearney, Dolph, Apu

### ACT TWO (Flashback Continued)

**Location:** Town Square - Jebediah Springfield Statue
**Characters:** Bart, Jimbo, Kearney, Dolph

The group hangs out at the Jebediah Springfield statue in the town square. They throw rocks at it.

While watching clouds, the bullies joke about how funny it would be if someone cut off the statue's head. They mock the town's reverence for the founder.

Bart initially defends the statue and Jebediah's importance to Springfield. The bullies ridicule him for caring.

**Jimbo/Kearney/Dolph:** Dismiss their own comments as just "cloud talk" - not something they'd actually do.

Bart feels humiliated and desperate to prove himself.

#### Scene 7: Simpson Home - Night
**Location:** 742 Evergreen Terrace - Bart's Room
**Characters:** Bart

That night, Bart lies awake thinking about what the bullies said. He wants their approval and respect.

Making a fateful decision, Bart sneaks out of the house with a hacksaw.

#### Scene 8: Town Square - The Decapitation
**Location:** Town Square - Jebediah Springfield Statue
**Characters:** Bart

In the dark of night, Bart climbs the statue of Jebediah Springfield.

Bart takes the head and sneaks home, hiding it in his room.

#### Scene 9: Bart's Room - Morning
**Location:** 742 Evergreen Terrace - Bart's Room
**Characters:** Bart, Jebediah's head

Bart wakes up to find the severed statue head in bed next to him.

**Reference:** This mirrors the famous scene in The Godfather where Jack Woltz finds a horse's head in his bed.

The head seems to be looking at him accusingly.

---

### ACT THREE (Flashback Continued)

#### Scene 10: Radio/Town Reaction
**Location:** Various - Simpson home, town
**Characters:** Bart, Homer, Marge, Lisa, radio announcer, townspeople

Bart listens nervously as Springfield citizens express their fury.

#### Scene 11: Meeting the Bullies
**Location:** Springfield
**Characters:** Bart, Jimbo, Kearney, Dolph

Bart finds the bullies, expecting praise and acceptance. He shows them the severed head, proud of his accomplishment.

To his shock, the bullies are horrified. They deny ever wanting someone to actually do it - that was just "cloud talk." They reject Bart completely.

**Jimbo:** They want to bash in the face of whoever did this.

Bart is devastated. He committed this crime for nothing.

#### Scene 12: Town Outrage Montage
**Location:** Various Springfield locations
**Characters:** Chief Wiggum, Mr. Burns, townspeople, Moe, Krusty

The entire town becomes consumed with finding the vandal:

- An angry mob forms
- Even Krusty the Clown and Sideshow Bob are outraged

**Note:** Burns crying and joining the mob is unusual for his character - an example of Early Installment Weirdness.

#### Scene 13: Bart's Guilt
**Location:** 742 Evergreen Terrace
**Characters:** Bart, the head (hallucination)

Bart's guilt becomes overwhelming. He begins hallucinating that the statue's head is talking to him, accusing him.

#### Scene 14: The Confession
**Location:** 742 Evergreen Terrace
**Characters:** Bart, Lisa, Marge, Homer

Unable to bear the guilt, Bart confesses to Lisa and Marge. Homer initially assumed Bart's guilt when he first heard about the crime.

Homer realizes they must return the head and face the town.

---

### RETURN TO PRESENT: Town Square

#### Scene 15: Facing the Mob
**Location:** Town Square
**Characters:** Homer, Bart, angry mob, townspeople

Back in the present moment from the opening. Homer and Bart are cornered by the angry mob at the base of the headless statue.

Bart musters his courage and addresses the crowd. He confesses that he cut off the head, but explains:
- He was pressured by bullies who said they wanted it done
- He was seeking their approval
- He realizes he made a terrible mistake
- He's truly sorry

Bart's sincere confession and obvious remorse touch the townspeople.

#### Scene 16: Forgiveness
**Location:** Town Square
**Characters:** Bart, Homer, townspeople, Jimbo, Kearney, Dolph

The mob's anger fades. The townspeople forgive Bart, recognizing that he's a child who made a mistake due to peer pressure.

Bart places the head back on the statue (to be properly reattached later).

The bullies who encouraged Bart receive disapproving looks from the crowd.

The Simpsons head home, the crisis resolved.
