## Synopsis

When Marge tries to hide the annual Springfield Chili Cook-Off from Homer—fearing a repeat of his embarrassing drunken behavior from the previous year—she goes to extreme lengths including cutting ads from the newspaper, intercepting phone calls, and even smoking a cigarette to mask the smell wafting over town. Homer eventually discovers the event and attends, promising Marge he won't drink beer. At the cook-off, Chief Wiggum challenges Homer's legendary chili-eating abilities with a batch containing Guatemalan Insanity Peppers grown by inmates at a Guatemalan asylum. Despite coating his mouth with candle wax for protection, Homer eats the peppers and experiences a profound hallucinatory vision quest. In a surreal desert landscape, Homer meets a mystical Space Coyote spirit guide (voiced by Johnny Cash) who tells him to find his soulmate and questions whether Marge truly fills that role. After waking up on a golf course, Homer becomes convinced that he and Marge aren't soulmates and embarks on a quest to find his true match. His search leads him to the lighthouse, where he believes the "loneliest person in town" must live. Discovering the lighthouse is automated by a machine called E.A.R.L., Homer accidentally damages the mechanism. Marge arrives and helps repair it, and the couple reconciles as they realize they truly are soulmates.
