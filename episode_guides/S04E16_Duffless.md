## Synopsis

After Homer skips work to attend a Duff Brewery tour with Barney, he's arrested for drunk driving despite performing reasonably on a sobriety test (while Barney, who is visibly intoxicated, is inexplicably allowed to leave). Homer is sentenced to attend traffic school and Alcoholics Anonymous meetings, and Marge convinces him to give up beer for one month. As Homer struggles with sobriety, he gradually begins to experience the benefits - losing weight, saving money, and becoming more present for his family. Meanwhile, Lisa seeks revenge on Bart after he destroys her science fair project (a giant steroid-enhanced tomato) by creating a new project that attempts to prove Bart is "dumber than a hamster." At the science fair, Bart counters with his own hamster-based project - a miniature plane piloted by a hamster - and wins first prize. After completing his 30 days of sobriety, Homer rushes to Moe's Tavern but, seeing the effects of alcohol on the barflies, chooses to leave with Marge instead.
