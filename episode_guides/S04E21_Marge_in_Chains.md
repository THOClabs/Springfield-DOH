## Synopsis

When a flu-infected Japanese factory worker coughs into a package containing a Juice Loosener bound for Homer Simpson, the "Osaka Flu" spreads through Springfield. The entire Simpson family falls ill except Marge, who exhausts herself caring for them. During a Kwik-E-Mart run, an overtired Marge accidentally slips a bottle of bourbon into her pocket and forgets to pay. She is arrested for shoplifting and, despite an obviously innocent mistake, is convicted after a disastrous trial led by Lionel Hutz. Marge is sentenced to 30 days in prison. Her absence causes chaos - the family falls apart, and when the town's bake sale fails without her marshmallow squares, Springfield can only afford a Jimmy Carter statue instead of Abraham Lincoln, triggering citywide riots.

- He attempts jury tampering

**The Jury Tampering:** Hutz submits the verdict himself on a cocktail napkin that still says "guilty" - and "guilty" is spelled wrong.

**Judge Snyder:** Declares a mistrial (or as Hutz calls it, "one of those bad court thingies").

A new trial is held - Marge is found guilty.
