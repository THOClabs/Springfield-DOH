## Synopsis

At Springfield Minimum Security Prison, Sideshow Bob grows increasingly disgusted with his fellow inmates' obsession with mindless television, particularly Krusty the Clown's show. Believing television is a "fountain of mindless drivel," Bob escapes during work duty at a local Air Force base during an air show. By impersonating a colonel, he gains access to a restricted hangar and steals a 10-megaton nuclear weapon. Bob broadcasts a televised ultimatum: Springfield must eliminate all television broadcasting within two hours or he will detonate the bomb. Mayor Quimby capitulates and TV stations shut down, but Krusty continues broadcasting from a civil defense bunker using the Emergency Broadcast System. Bob tracks down the pirate broadcast, kidnaps Bart, and commandeers a Duff blimp. After the nuclear bomb proves to be a non-functional dud, Bob attempts to crash the Wright Brothers' replica airplane into Krusty's shack. His plans are foiled, and Bob is recaptured. This episode marks the fifth major appearance of Sideshow Bob and the directorial debut of Dominic Polcino.
