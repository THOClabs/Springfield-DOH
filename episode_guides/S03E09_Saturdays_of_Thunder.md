## Synopsis

When Marge gives Homer a fatherhood quiz that reveals he knows almost nothing about Bart, Homer is devastated. After attending the National Fatherhood Institute, Homer tries to bond with Bart by helping him build a soapbox derby racer called "Li'l Lightnin'." Unfortunately, their racer is a pathetic failure compared to Martin Prince's NASA-designed "Honor Roller." When Martin crashes and breaks his arm, he offers Bart his superior racer - forcing Bart to choose between loyalty to his father and his desire to win.
