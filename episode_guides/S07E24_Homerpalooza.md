## Synopsis

When Otto destroys the school bus, Homer is forced to carpool Bart, Lisa, and several other students to school. He is horrified to discover that the kids hate his classic rock music and mock his outdated taste. This triggers an existential crisis for Homer, who realizes he's no longer considered cool. Determined to prove his relevance, Homer takes Bart and Lisa to the Hullabalooza music festival (a parody of Lollapalooza). At the festival, Homer is mistaken for an undercover police officer by hostile Generation X concertgoers and thrown out. In a rage, he kicks a cannon that shoots one of Peter Frampton's inflatable pigs into his stomach - and absorbs the impact without harm. A festival promoter is impressed by Homer's unique ability to take punishment and recruits him for the "Pageant of the Transmundane" freak show. Homer tours with Hullabalooza, taking cannonballs to the gut nightly while partying with rock and rap stars Sonic Youth, Cypress Hill, and The Smashing Pumpkins. He earns the respect of young people, including Bart. But as the tour approaches a stop in Springfield, Homer's stomach begins to ache. A veterinarian (mistaken for a medical doctor) warns Homer that another cannonball hit will kill him. Homer must choose between his newfound fame and his life. In the final performance, Homer dodges the cannonball at the last second, choosing survival over coolness. He leaves the festival with a warm sendoff from the bands, though he loses his children's respect - which he accepts with newfound maturity.
