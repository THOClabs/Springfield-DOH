## Synopsis

This groundbreaking anthology episode presents a day in the life of Springfield through approximately 22 interconnected vignettes, each focusing on different residents of the town. The episode opens with Bart and Milhouse sitting on an overpass, wondering if "anything interesting ever happens" to the people of Springfield. What follows is a kaleidoscopic journey through the untold stories of the town's citizens.

The format pays homage to the 1993 film "Thirty Two Short Films About Glenn Gould" while incorporating elements of Quentin Tarantino's "Pulp Fiction" in its structure and specific sequences. The stories range from the mundane to the absurd, from Lisa getting gum stuck in her hair to Principal Skinner attempting to pass off fast-food burgers as "steamed hams," to Chief Wiggum and Snake getting held hostage in a military antique shop.

The episode demonstrates that every Springfield resident, no matter how minor, has their own fascinating story to tell. It concludes with Bart and Milhouse realizing that yes, interesting things do happen to everyone in Springfield - they just don't have time to hear them all.

**Chalmers:** "Really? Well, I'm from Utica and I've never heard anyone use the phrase 'steamed hams.'"
