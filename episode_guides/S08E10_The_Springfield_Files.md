## Synopsis

Leonard Nimoy hosts a paranormal investigation show and narrates this strange tale of Homer Simpson's encounter with the unknown. After sneaking out to Moe's Tavern one Friday night using a VCR tape loop to fool Marge, Homer has too much Red Tick Beer and is forced to walk home at 1am when Moe cuts him off. Lost in the woods, Homer encounters a glowing green creature that speaks to him, saying "Don't be afraid." Homer panics and flees. When he tells his family and the authorities about the alien, no one believes him—not even FBI agents Fox Mulder and Dana Scully, who arrive from Washington to investigate. Homer and Bart return to the woods with a video camera and capture footage of the creature, which airs on Channel 6 News and becomes a sensation. The entire town camps out in the woods to witness the alien's return. When the creature appears, Lisa solves the mystery: it's not an alien at all, but Mr. Burns, whose weekly longevity treatments leave him disoriented, gentle-voiced, and glowing green from radiation. The town celebrates with a musical number as Burns, after a booster shot from Dr. Nick, reverts to his normal cantankerous self.
