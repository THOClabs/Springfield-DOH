## Plot Summary

### Main Plot A: The Comic Book Store War

When Bart, Lisa, and Milhouse discover a new comic book store called Coolsville, it quickly becomes their favorite hangout. The store is owned by Milo (voiced by Jack Black), a friendly and enthusiastic comic book enthusiast who treats his customers with respect and kindness - a stark contrast to the Comic Book Guy's condescending attitude at The Android's Dungeon.

Coolsville becomes even more popular when it hosts a book signing featuring three legendary comic book creators appearing as themselves: Alan Moore, Art Spiegelman, and Dan Clowes. At the event, Milhouse asks Alan Moore to sign a DVD of "Watchmen Babies in V for Vacation" (a parody combining Watchmen and V for Vendetta), which causes Moore to have an outburst - referencing the real Alan Moore's well-known opposition to film adaptations of his work.

During Coolsville's grand opening, Milo surprises everyone by performing a Korean rendition of Tom Jones' classic "What's New Pussycat" (called "Anyong Pussycat"), enthusiastically proclaiming Korean covers of Tom Jones songs as one of his favorite genres.

Jealous of Coolsville's success and losing all his customers, the Comic Book Guy attempts to sabotage Milo's store. When his schemes fail, he launches a full assault on Coolsville using "Japanese weapons." However, the three comic book creators reveal themselves as the "League of Extraordinary Freelancers" (a reference to Alan Moore's "The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen"). They remove their shirts to reveal muscular superhero physiques - Alan Moore shouts "League of Extraordinary Freelancers activate!" while Art Spiegelman puts on a mouse mask (based on his character in "Maus") and declares "Maus is in the house!" They successfully subdue the Comic Book Guy.

### Main Plot B: Marge's Gym and Homer's Insecurity

After comparing herself to a cardboard cutout of Wonder Woman at The Android's Dungeon, Marge decides she needs to get in shape. She joins a large commercial gym but has a humiliating experience - she struggles on the treadmill while watching fitness buffs (Miss Springfield, Cookie Kwan, Duffman, and Rainier Wolfcastle) effortlessly performing choreography from OK Go's "Here It Goes Again" music video (complete with the actual song playing). She's also embarrassed by the public showers with glass panes opening to the street.

Realizing there's a need for a gym where "regular women" can exercise comfortably, Marge opens her own gym called "Shapes" in the now-vacant Android's Dungeon space (after Comic Book Guy loses his business to Coolsville). The gym features the slogan "I am woman, hear me sweat" (a reference to Helen Reddy's "I Am Woman") and becomes wildly successful.

As Marge's business success grows, Homer becomes increasingly insecure, fearing she will leave him for a younger, more attractive "trophy husband." In his desperation, Homer decides to undergo extensive plastic surgery to make himself look like a handsome hunk.

The surgery appears successful, transforming Homer into an attractive man. However, Homer's new appearance causes chaos in Springfield. Eventually, Homer and Marge run to the top of Springfield's Notre Dame tower to avoid angry townspeople. Marge, saying she wants a trophy husband, deliberately pushes Homer off the tower.

Homer wakes up in the hospital, back to his old self. Marge reveals that everything from the plastic surgery to his "death" was just a dream - when the surgeon requested her permission for the surgery, she refused. She also had the doctor reverse Homer's stomach stapling, explaining that she loves him no matter how he looks.

### Epilogue

The episode ends with Moore, Spiegelman, and Clowes watching Homer and Marge from mid-air (having apparently gained superpowers). They notice that a meteor is headed for Earth, but become distracted from destroying it when they hear news of a convention for underpaid writers - a meta-commentary on the 2007-2008 Writers Guild strike.

## Production Notes and Trivia

### Alan Moore's Participation
- Alan Moore recorded his lines in October 2006, after the writers approached his then-fiancée Melinda Gebbie
- Moore is said to be a fan of The Simpsons
- The episode aired on Moore's 54th birthday (November 18, 2007)
- Moore's outburst at the "Watchmen Babies" DVD is a reference to his real opposition to Hollywood adaptations of his work - he demanded his name not appear in the credits of the V for Vendetta film

### Jack Black's Musical Performance
- In the first draft of the script, the Korean pop song was supposed to be "Goldfinger"
- Jack Black spent over an hour perfectly singing the phonetically-translated lyrics in Korean
- Four months later, they discovered "Goldfinger" did not "clear" - the rights owners wouldn't allow its use
- They had to call Jack Black back to record a second Korean song, which became "What's New Pussycat"
- The song was performed by Jack Black, Dan Castellaneta, and Sang Am Lee (credited as Korean Singer)
- During the end credits, Jack Black sings "What's New Pussycat" in Korean, then breaks character to say: "Might be some wrong words in there, but, uh, pretty much nailed it."

### Ironic Future Developments
- The "Watchmen Babies" joke became "hilarious in hindsight" when DC Comics actually brought back the Watchmen cast for several stories starting in 2011, done without Moore's involvement or permission
- In 2019, DC released a literal "Spin-Off Babies" version of Swamp Thing (which Moore made famous) called "Swamp Kid"

### Art Spiegelman's Mouse Mask
- The mask Art Spiegelman wears when attacking Comic Book Guy is based on the mask he drew himself wearing as an illustrator in "Maus"

### Shapes Gym
- While "Shapes" parodies the national chain Curves, there was actually a real fitness chain in the Tampa, Florida area also called Shapes

**Chalkboard Gag:** Bart writes a line making a joking claim about early North American settlers from Europe, suggesting that by modern criteria, many would be considered illegal immigrants. This gag is completely disconnected from the episode's plot.

## Themes and Analysis

### Customer Service vs. Gatekeeping
The episode contrasts two approaches to nerd culture retail: Comic Book Guy's elitist, condescending gatekeeping versus Milo's inclusive, welcoming approach. This reflects real debates within geek culture about accessibility and toxicity in fan communities.

### Body Image and Acceptance
Both plotlines deal with body image issues - Marge feeling inadequate compared to fitness models, and Homer fearing he's not attractive enough for his successful wife. The resolution promotes self-acceptance and unconditional love.

### The Creative Industry
The ending commentary about "underpaid writers" being distracted from saving the world is a meta-reference to the 2007-2008 Writers Guild strike, highlighting how even superhero-like comic creators face economic struggles.

### Alternative Comics in Mainstream Media
By featuring Alan Moore, Art Spiegelman, and Dan Clowes - three giants of alternative and literary comics - the episode gives mainstream exposure to creators who work outside superhero comics, educating viewers about the breadth of the medium.
