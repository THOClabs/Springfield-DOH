## Synopsis

During a massive snowstorm, Homer crashes Marge's car while driving drunk from Moe's Tavern. To replace the car, Homer goes to a dealership and is talked into buying a snowplow. He starts a snow plowing business called "Mr. Plow" and becomes a local hero, even producing a catchy TV commercial. When his friend Barney sees Homer's success, he starts a rival plowing business called "Plow King" with superior equipment and a celebrity endorsement from Linda Ronstadt. As the two friends compete viciously for customers, their friendship deteriorates. Homer ultimately tricks Barney into plowing a dangerous road up a mountain, where an avalanche traps him. Realizing what he's done, Homer rescues Barney, and the two reconcile. However, when spring arrives and the snow melts, both businesses fail, and the friends return to drinking at Moe's, their rivalry forgotten.
