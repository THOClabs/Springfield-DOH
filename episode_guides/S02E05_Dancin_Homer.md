## Synopsis

Homer tells his drinking buddies at Moe's Tavern the story of how he became a local celebrity. At a baseball game, Homer's drunken dancing to "Baby Elephant Walk" energizes the crowd and helps the Springfield Isotopes win. The team owner hires Homer as the team mascot, and his performances lead to a winning streak. Homer is promoted to the big leagues as backup for the Capital City Goofball, and the family relocates to Capital City. However, the jaded big-city crowd doesn't appreciate Homer's act, and he's quickly fired, forcing the family to return to Springfield in defeat.
