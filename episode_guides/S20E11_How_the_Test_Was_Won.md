## Synopsis

Springfield Elementary faces a national achievement test, and the school is in a frenzy. Principal Skinner devises a scheme to boost the school's scores: send the underachieving students away on a fake "reward trip" so they can't bring down the average. Bart, believing he scored perfectly on a practice test for writing an inappropriate phrase, boards what he thinks is a helicopter to a pizza party—only to discover it's the school bus in disguise, and his fellow "geniuses" are Ralph, Nelson, and the bullies. Meanwhile, Lisa is rattled after scoring "only" 96% on the practice test and freezes during the real exam, unable to answer a single question. In the B-plot, Homer realizes he forgot to mail the insurance payment and must prevent anyone from getting injured in the Simpson house until 3:00 PM when coverage resumes. The episode culminates with Skinner having a change of heart, returning just in time to throw out the tests and declare that he's learned how children really learn.
