## Synopsis

When Nuclear Regulatory Commission inspectors arrive at the Springfield Nuclear Power Plant for a surprise evaluation, Homer spectacularly fails by causing a meltdown in a simulation van that contains no nuclear material. To avoid legal action, Mr. Burns forces Homer to attend Springfield University to earn a degree in nuclear physics. At college, Homer expects the stereotypical jock-versus-nerd dynamic from movies like "Revenge of the Nerds," but instead finds a progressive institution run by the laid-back Dean Bobby Peterson. Homer befriends three nerdy tutors - Benjamin, Doug, and Gary - and drags them into increasingly bad decisions, including kidnapping a rival school's mascot pig and getting it drunk. When the nerds are unfairly expelled, Homer takes them into his home, where they annoy the entire Simpson family. Ultimately, Homer confesses the truth and the nerds help him pass his final exam by hacking into the college database.
