## Synopsis

Lisa Simpson creates Springfield Code, an AI-powered coding assistant with Simpsons character personalities, and gives her father Homer 10,000 micro-USB drives to distribute at major AI conferences. Homer's journey through NeurIPS, OpenAI DevDay, Nvidia GTC, Y Combinator Demo Day, and other tech events becomes an accidental masterclass in viral marketing when his leaky backpack scatters USB drives in VIP areas, executive lounges, and everywhere he shouldn't be. Through encounters with satirical versions of AI luminaries - Sham Alltalk, Geoff Hindsight, Elon Tusk, Jensen Leatherjacket, and others - Homer unwittingly achieves 10x Lisa's projected distribution reach, proving that sometimes the best strategy is no strategy at all.

## Scene-by-Scene Breakdown

### Opening Sequence

**Chalkboard Gag:** "ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE IS NOT A DONUT"

**Couch Gag:** The family runs to the couch, but an AI-generated version of themselves is already sitting there. The real Simpsons stare in confusion. AI Homer waves and says "D'oh!" in a slightly robotic voice. Real Homer pushes AI Homer off: "Get your own couch, robot me!" The family sits down as dozens of micro-USB drives fall from the ceiling like confetti.

---

### ACT ONE

*Runtime: Approximately 25 minutes*

#### Scene 1: Lisa's Lab - USB Preparation Montage
**Location:** Lisa's Bedroom / Makeshift Laboratory
**Characters:** Lisa, Bart, Maggie

Lisa's bedroom has been transformed into a miniature electronics workshop. Her saxophone case is pushed to the corner, and her desk is covered with tiny components, a soldering iron, and a laptop displaying code. A small machine hums quietly, producing micro-USB drives that drop into a glass jar like candy from a vending machine.

Lisa carefully inspects each drive through a magnifying glass mounted on an articulated arm. The drives are impossibly small - barely bigger than a fingernail. On her laptop screen, the Springfield Code logo glows alongside cascading telemetry data streams.

> **Lisa** *adjusts glasses*: "Each micro-USB contains the full Springfield Code trial installation, optimized documentation, and..." *hesitates* "...a telemetry module."

She pauses, setting down a drive. Her reflection stares back from the laptop screen.

> **Lisa** *softly*: "It's completely anonymized. I'm not tracking people - just usage patterns. Which features they use. How long sessions last. It's standard industry practice."

*She plays a contemplative saxophone riff - minor key, uncertain*

> **Lisa**: "Besides, if I want Springfield Code to compete with the big AI companies, I need data. They have billions of users. I have..." *looks at jar* "...ten thousand tiny sprinkles of hope."

The door bursts open. Bart slides in on his skateboard, reaching for the jar of completed drives.

> **Bart** *evil grin*: "Hey Lis, whatcha got there? Looks valuable. Looks like something that should be MINE!"

> **Lisa** *saxophone squeak*: "Bart! Those aren't toys!"

> **Bart**: "Everything's a toy if you're creative enough. I bet I could sell these at school. 'Hey kids, want some mystery computer candy?'"

In the corner, Maggie toddles over to a dropped USB drive on the floor. She picks it up, examines it with infant intensity, then *squeak* - points at a tiny blinking LED on the drive.

**Easter Egg:** The serial numbers on Lisa's USB drives begin with "SPFLD-001" - the same prefix used in the Springfield Code plugin manifest.

---

#### Scene 2: Briefing Homer
**Location:** Simpson Family Kitchen
**Characters:** Homer, Lisa, Marge, Bart, Maggie

The kitchen table is covered with papers, charts, and a large map of North America with red dots marking cities. Lisa stands at the head of the table like a military commander. Homer sits across from her, a box of donuts open in front of him, eyes glazed - focused entirely on a maple bar.

> **Lisa** *adjusts glasses*: "Dad, this is important. I need you to pay attention."

> **Homer**: "Mmm... maple bar..."

Lisa taps the map with a pointer she's fashioned from a ruler and a ping-pong ball.

> **Lisa**: "AI conferences, Dad. Five of them across ten days. NeurIPS in Vancouver, OpenAI DevDay in San Francisco, NVIDIA GTC, a Y Combinator Demo Day, and a smaller academic symposium in Portland."

> **Homer** *scratches head*: "Neural... what now?"

> **Lisa**: "Neural Information Processing Systems. It's the premier machine learning conference in the world. The smartest AI researchers on the planet will be there."

> **Homer** *perks up*: "Smart people? I got nothing in common with those guys!"

Lisa produces an old hiking backpack from under the table. It's faded blue, clearly from the early 90s, with a barely visible "SPRINGFIELD ISOTOPES 1987" patch.

> **Lisa**: "I found this in the garage. It should hold all the drives plus your travel essentials."

He takes it, examining it with nostalgia. Neither he nor Lisa notices a small worn spot near one of the bottom seams - a spot that will become important very soon.

**Production Note:** The "Springfield Isotopes 1987" patch references the season 12 episode "Hungry, Hungry Homer" where the Isotopes baseball team is prominently featured.

---

#### Scene 3: Airport Departure
**Location:** Springfield International Airport
**Characters:** Homer, Marge, Bart, Lisa, Maggie, various airport personnel

The Simpson family stands at the security checkpoint. Homer is wearing his "best" travel outfit - his normal white shirt and blue pants, plus a baseball cap that reads "WORLD'S BEST DAD (PROBABLY)."

The backpack, bulging with USB drives, sits heavily on his shoulders. As Homer goes through TSA screening, his backpack catches on the edge of a plastic bin as he yanks it off - and the fabric near that weak seam TEARS. A tiny rip. Barely visible.

Neither Homer nor the TSA agent notices. But through the hole, one micro-USB drive - catching the fluorescent airport light - drops silently to the rubber belt. The drive rolls. It falls between the belt and the X-ray machine housing. Gone.

In the background, Maggie watches. *squeak* She points at the X-ray machine. No one sees what Maggie sees: a tiny blinking LED, barely visible in the gap between machine and belt, where the first of ten thousand USB drives has begun its unplanned journey.

*suck suck*

**Easter Egg:** The TSA agent's name badge reads "Agent Fury" - a reference to the season 8 episode featuring a secret agent subplot.

---

#### Scene 4: Arrival at NeurIPS Vancouver
**Location:** Vancouver Convention Centre West Building
**Characters:** Homer, various AI researchers, PhD students

The Vancouver Convention Centre gleams against the Pacific waterfront. Mountains rise in the distance. Homer exits a taxi, staring up at the building with his mouth open. His backpack hangs loose on one shoulder.

> **Homer**: "Wooooow. This is where the nerds live?"

He tries to follow a group heading inside but goes through the wrong door. Instead of the registration area, he finds himself in the midst of a POSTER SESSION - a massive hall filled with research posters mounted on display boards.

The posters are dense with mathematics, graphs, and titles like:
- "Emergent Capabilities in Large Language Models: A Scaling Law Analysis"
- "Attention Mechanisms for Multi-Modal Fusion in Embodied AI"
- "Constitutional AI: Training Assistants to Be Helpful, Harmless, and Honest"

Homer stares at them like they're written in alien languages.

> **Homer**: "What the..." *reads slowly* "Con-sti-tu-tional AI? Is that like when the robots have to follow the Constitution? Second Amendment for robots? Can robots bear arms? They already HAVE arms..."

A nearby PhD student, a young woman with thick glasses and a MIT hoodie, notices Homer's confusion.

> **PhD Student**: "Can I help you find something?"

> **Homer**: "Oh! Thanks! Hey, what's all this?" *gestures at posters*

> **PhD Student**: "It's the poster session. Researchers present their papers here."

> **Homer**: "Mmm... I have no idea what you just said, but here's a USB thingy! My daughter made 'em!"

He fumbles with his backpack, not noticing that three more drives have fallen through the growing hole in the seam.

**Easter Egg:** One of the posters visible in the background is titled "The Ralph Hypothesis: Achieving AGI Through Intuitive Reasoning" - a reference to the Springfield Code Ralph agent.

---

#### Scene 5: Poster Session Wanderings
**Location:** NeurIPS Poster Session Hall
**Characters:** Homer, various researchers, PhD students

Homer weaves through the poster session like a confused tourist at an art museum, leaving a trail of fallen USBs in his wake.

At a poster about TRANSFORMER ARCHITECTURE:

> **Homer**: "Ooh, transformers! Like the cartoon! Optimus Prime!" *reads title* "'Transformer-Based Sequential Decision Making for...' Wait, this isn't about robots that turn into trucks at all. I've been lied to!"

At a poster about LATENT SPACE:

> **Homer**: "'Exploring Latent Space for Generative Models'... Latent space? Is that where I go during meetings? I call it 'the zone.' My boss calls it 'grounds for termination.'"

More drives fall. Homer doesn't notice. Behind him, a small cluster of curious researchers have gathered around the dropped drives.

> **Researcher 3**: "These are really well-made. Check out the manufacturing quality."

> **Researcher 4**: "Springfield Code... never heard of it. Only one way to find out."

---

#### Scene 6: Homer Meets Geoff Hindsight
**Location:** NeurIPS Hallway / Coffee Area
**Characters:** Homer, Geoff Hindsight (Geoffrey Hinton parody)

Homer pushes through a set of double doors, escaping the poster session into a wide hallway. There's a coffee station here. One person catches Homer's attention: an elderly man with wispy gray hair and kind but deeply worried eyes. He's PACING - back and forth, back and forth.

This is GEOFF HINDSIGHT, the "Grandfather of AI." He never sits. He never stops moving.

> **Geoff** *pacing, to no one in particular*: "You see, the problem isn't what AI can do NOW. It's what it WILL do. We're building minds, and we have no idea what they'll think about us!"

Homer, heading for the coffee, accidentally steps into Geoff's pacing path. They collide.

> **Homer**: "D'oh!"

> **Geoff**: "Oh! Terribly sorry! I never stop moving, you know - bad back. Sitting is death for me."

> **Homer**: "Never sits? That's MY worst nightmare!"

> **Geoff** *continuing to pace, now circling Homer*: "You know, I've been thinking about the fundamental problem of intelligence. We've created something that LEARNS. And once it learns enough... it could become smarter than us!"

> **Homer** *grins*: "Woohoo! No more work! The robots can do my job!"

Geoff stops pacing for exactly one second - the longest he's been still all day - and stares at Homer.

> **Geoff**: "No, you don't understand. This is EXISTENTIAL RISK. The end of humanity as we know it!"

> **Homer** *sips coffee*: "50%? Hey, those are the same odds as my diet working! And look at me - still fat!" *laughs, pats belly*

As Homer hoists his backpack to leave, yet another USB drive drops to the floor. Geoff watches Homer lumber away, then notices the drive. He picks it up.

> **Geoff**: "'Springfield Code'..." *turns it over* "What's this then?"

He pockets it, resumes pacing.

> **Geoff** *muttering as he walks*: "Unpredictable distribution methods... adversarial robustness through chaos... there might be something here..."

**Production Note:** Geoff never sits in any scene - a character trait based on the real Geoffrey Hinton's chronic back pain.

---

#### Scene 7: First Lisa Analytics Interlude
**Location:** Lisa's Bedroom, Simpson House
**Characters:** Lisa, Marge, Bart (briefly)

Lisa's room glows with the blue light of multiple screens. Her main laptop shows a dashboard with a world map, currently focused on the Vancouver region. Dots pulse like heartbeats - each one a Springfield Code activation.

> **Lisa** *adjusts glasses*: "The telemetry is working!"

The map shows a cluster of activations around the Vancouver Convention Centre - the exact pattern of Homer's chaotic journey through the poster session.

> **Lisa**: "Forty-seven activations in the first two hours. That's a 4.7% conversion rate! Dad must be really connecting with people!"

Marge enters, carrying a laundry basket.

> **Marge** *Hmmmm*: "Lisa, sweetie, what are all those dots?"

> **Lisa**: "Users, Mom! Each dot is someone who plugged in a Springfield Code drive!"

> **Marge**: "Hmmmm... should you be tracking people, sweetie?"

> **Lisa** *defensive*: "It's completely anonymized, Mom. I just see usage patterns. Every software company does this."

> **Marge** *gently*: "Lisa, honey. Just because everyone does something doesn't make it right. You've told ME that about a hundred times."

Lisa pauses. Her mother has a point.

> **Lisa** *softly*: "I know. That's why I made sure the data is completely anonymous. No names, no emails. Just... which buttons they press."

A notification pings. Lisa looks at the screen.

> **Lisa** *adjusts glasses*: "What's this? A feature request already! 'Add more characters.'"

---

#### Scene 8: Day 2 - More NeurIPS Chaos
**Location:** Vancouver Convention Centre - Various Areas
**Characters:** Homer, Security Guard, various conference attendees, Nvidia booth staff

Morning light streams through the Convention Centre's massive windows. Homer is NOT among the early-bird researchers.

Homer is ASLEEP on a bench in the poster session area, using his backpack as a pillow. Someone has draped a conference t-shirt over him like a blanket.

A SECURITY GUARD approaches.

> **Security Guard**: "Sir? Sir, you can't sleep here."

> **Homer** *waking groggily*: "Wha... where... This isn't my hotel."

> **Security Guard**: "No sir, this is the poster session hall. You've been here all night."

Homer produces his conference badge.

> **Security Guard**: "This badge gives you access to the VIP exhibitor area. Why were you sleeping on a bench?"

> **Homer** *tears up*: "Lisa made me a VIP. My little girl made me important!"

**LATER - NVIDIA BOOTH**

Homer has found his way to the industry expo, and specifically to the NVIDIA booth. It's massive - a cathedral of GPUs and LED lighting.

Homer stands before a giant screen, mouth agape, watching as an AI generates images of... donuts.

> **Nvidia Rep**: "Using our latest architecture, we can generate these photorealistic images in under three seconds."

> **Homer**: "More donuts! Make them BIGGER!"

The screen fills with enormous, impossibly perfect donuts. Homer drools.

> **Homer**: "So... the donuts aren't real?"

> **Nvidia Rep**: "No."

> **Homer** *tears up*: "That's the saddest thing I've ever heard."

He dumps USB drives on the booth counter and shuffles away, genuinely sad about the donuts.

**End of Act One.**

### ACT TWO: THE ODYSSEY

*Homer's 10-Day Journey Through AI Conference Season*
*Runtime: Approximately 40 minutes*

---

#### Scene 9: Day 3 - Anthropic Safety Summit (San Francisco)
**Location:** Moscone Center West, San Francisco
**Characters:** Homer, Clawed Anthropic (Dario Amodei parody), Safety Researchers

Homer stumbles into the Anthropic Safety Summit having followed signs that read "AI Safety Summit" which he interpreted as "Car Safety Summit." He's wearing his Springfield Nuclear Power Plant hard hat.

The keynote stage features an elaborate underground bunker set piece. At the podium stands Clawed Anthropic, a tall, gaunt figure with perpetually worried eyes who keeps glancing at exit signs.

> **Clawed Anthropic:** *pacing nervously* "Thank you all for attending. Before we begin, I want to remind everyone that the bunker beneath this stage is fully operational. Not that we'll need it. Probably."

Homer wanders to the front row.

> **Homer:** "Excuse me! When do we get to crash test the dummies?"

> **Clawed Anthropic:** *stares in horror* "Did you just call our research team... dummies?"

A safety researcher notices Homer's backpack leaking USB drives onto the floor. She picks one up, examining it with the intensity of someone defusing a bomb.

> **Safety Researcher:** "Sir, what is this device? Is it aligned?"

> **Homer:** "It's a computer sprinkle! My daughter made them. They help you do the typing but with more fun!"

> **Safety Researcher:** *into walkie-talkie* "We have an unknown computational artifact. Initiating Level 3 alignment analysis protocol."

Clawed Anthropic has descended into his bunker, convinced the USB drives are the first wave of an AI takeover.

> **Clawed Anthropic:** *voice echoing from bunker* "This is exactly the scenario we trained for! The Constitutional AI principles will protect us! Probably!"

**Easter Egg:** One researcher's badge reads "Department of Existential Dread - 'We worry so you don't have to.'"

---

#### Scene 10: Day 4 - OpenAI DevDay (SF Convention Center)
**Location:** SF Convention Center, Backstage Area
**Characters:** Homer, Sham Alltalk (Sam Altman parody), OpenAI Engineers

Homer has somehow ended up backstage at OpenAI DevDay while searching for a bathroom. Giant screens display the OpenAI logo while a countdown clock shows 15 minutes to keynote.

Around a corner, Homer literally bumps into Sham Alltalk, a young man with an unnervingly calm demeanor, wearing a simple gray t-shirt. He speaks in slow, measured tones with strategic pauses.

> **Sham Alltalk:** *barely glancing at Homer* "You don't work here."

> **Homer:** "I don't work most places! That's never stopped me before!"

> **Sham Alltalk:** *evaluating Homer with unsettling intensity* "Wait. You could be useful. Hold these cables."

Homer is thrust into service. He immediately trips, yanking a cable that causes half the stage lights to flicker.

> **Stage Manager:** "Sir! You've disconnected the backup power!"

> **Sham Alltalk:** *philosophically* "The bad case is, like, lights-out for all of us."

> **Homer:** *perking up* "Finally, naptime! Woohoo!"

Homer's backpack continues its slow USB hemorrhage. A young engineer picks up one of the fallen drives.

> **Engineer:** *examining USB* "Hey, what's Springfield Code? Is this one of our skunkworks projects?"

> **Homer:** "It's my daughter's thing! Makes computers talk like people from my town!"

Sham Alltalk's keynote begins. Homer watches from backstage as the CEO speaks in hypnotic, carefully paced sentences.

> **Sham Alltalk:** *on stage* "Today... I want to talk about something important. The future. Your future. Whether that future includes all of us... depends on the choices we make... today."

> **Homer:** *whispering to nearby stagehand* "Is he okay? He talks like my GPS when it's buffering."

**Easter Egg:** A whiteboard visible backstage has "GPT-7 IDEAS" with items crossed out, including "Actually helpful" and "Remembers your name."

---

#### Scene 11: Day 5 - Nvidia GTC (San Jose Convention Center)
**Location:** San Jose Convention Center, Main Exhibition Hall
**Characters:** Homer, Jensen Leatherjacket (Jensen Huang parody), Conference Attendees

Homer arrives at Nvidia GTC having followed a food truck. The convention center is transformed into a cathedral of computing, with massive GPU displays everywhere.

> **Homer:** *eyes wide* "Ooh! Pretty glowy things! This is like Christmas but for nerds!"

The main hall features an elaborate stage where Jensen Leatherjacket is mid-keynote. He's a charismatic figure wearing what appears to be a black leather motorcycle jacket. Then Homer notices the display behind the speaker: 47 additional leather jackets arranged on mannequins.

> **Jensen Leatherjacket:** *strutting across stage in $8,990 lizard-embossed calfskin* "Ladies and gentlemen, I want to talk to you about acceleration. We don't just make GPUs. We make DREAMS. Dreams that you can BUY."

> **Homer:** *mesmerized* "Forty-seven jackets? Is he Fonzie's rich cousin?"

> **Jensen Leatherjacket:** "Here's the thing about our new Blackwell architecture: the more you buy, the more you save!"

> **Homer:** *having an epiphany* "Wait a minute... the more you buy, the more you save? That makes PERFECT sense!"

Homer immediately applies this logic to donuts. He rushes to the food court.

> **Homer:** *at food counter* "I'd like to buy ALL your donuts!"

> **Food Vendor:** "All of them? We have three hundred."

> **Homer:** "Perfect! That way I'll save the most money!"

Homer's backpack, now under the strain of 300 donuts, rips further. USBs cascade into a display of H100 GPUs.

> **Tech Enthusiast:** "Dude, someone dropped a USB. 'Springfield Code' - is this some kind of demo?"

He plugs it in. The screen displays the Springfield Code interface with Homer's character prominently featured.

> **Tech Enthusiast:** "Oh man, this is great! It's like a CLI with personality! Wait, are you Homer?"

> **Homer:** *proudly* "I'm EVERY Homer, my friend."

**Cultural Reference:** The "47 leather jackets" is an exaggeration of Jensen Huang's famous commitment to his signature look.

#### Scene 12: Lisa Analytics Interlude - Dashboard Rising
**Location:** Simpson Home, Lisa's Room
**Characters:** Lisa, Marge, Bart, Maggie

Lisa sits at her desk, surrounded by monitors displaying various dashboards. Her Springfield Code telemetry system shows a map of the Bay Area lighting up with new user activations like a spreading wildfire.

> **Lisa:** *adjusts glasses* "This is... statistically improbable. We've gone from 47 users to over 2,000 in 48 hours. Dad must be doing something right."

Lisa pulls up a categorized list of user feedback.

> **Lisa:** *reading* "'Make Ralph smarter' - that's been submitted 34 times by 34 different users." *sighs* "That's not a bug, that's the character."

Bart enters.

> **Bart:** "So how's your spy operation going, Lis?"

> **Lisa:** "It's RESEARCH, Bart! I'm studying how developers interact with AI-assisted coding tools!"

> **Bart:** "Sure, sure. And I'm 'studying' Milhouse's reactions when I steal his lunch. For science."

Maggie toddles in, pacifier bobbing. She points at Lisa's screen.

> *squeak*

> **Lisa:** "What is it, Maggie?"

Lisa follows Maggie's finger to a bug report: "URGENT: Ralph says nonsense - possible hallucination bug."

> **Lisa:** *sighs heavily* "That's not a bug. That IS Ralph."

**Easter Egg:** One of Lisa's monitors shows a graph labeled "Dad's Blood Sugar vs. USB Distribution Rate" with a suspiciously strong correlation.

---

#### Scene 13: Day 6 - AI Grant Demo Day (Palo Alto)
**Location:** AI Grant Headquarters, Palo Alto
**Characters:** Homer, Marc Andreeseen-and-raise (Marc Andreessen parody), VCs, Startup Founders

Homer enters the AI Grant Demo Day venue believing it's a talent show. Startup after startup presents cutting-edge AI applications. Homer grows increasingly confused as no one juggles anything.

Marc Andreeseen-and-raise sits in the front row, a larger-than-life figure with an oversized bald head that seems to reflect every light in the room.

Somehow, Homer's name gets called. There's been a mix-up with the sign-in sheet.

> **Moderator:** "Next up: Homer Simpson, presenting... 'Beer AI'?"

> **Homer:** *at podium, beaming* "Thank you, thank you! So, I've invented an AI that predicts when you need more beer!"

> **Marc Andreeseen-and-raise:** *leaning forward* "An anticipatory consumption algorithm? Continue."

> **Homer:** "The algorithm goes like this: 'Is there beer? Drink it. Is there no beer? Get more beer.'"

> **VC #3:** "That's... surprisingly elegant. What's the prediction accuracy?"

> **Homer:** *proudly* "One hundred percent! It always says 'now.' The answer is always 'now.'"

> **Marc Andreeseen-and-raise:** *standing up* "Constant consumption model... infinite demand generation... this could disrupt the entire beverage industry..."

> **VC #2:** "Marc, the algorithm literally just says 'always drink beer.'"

> **Marc Andreeseen-and-raise:** *pausing* "...Still better than half of what we've seen today."

Homer is gently escorted off stage, but not before his backpack catches on a chair and spills USBs across the demo floor.

Marc Andreeseen-and-raise picks up a fallen USB.

> **Marc Andreeseen-and-raise:** "Hmm. 'Springfield Code.' No pitch deck, no website, mysterious distribution model. This is either worthless or a $10 billion company. I'll take a meeting."

**Easter Egg:** A whiteboard in the background shows "STARTUP VALUATION FORMULA" with the equation crossed out and replaced with "VIBES."

---

#### Scene 14: Day 7 - Y Combinator AI Batch Demo Day (Mountain View)
**Location:** YC Offices
**Characters:** Homer, Elon Tusk (Elon Musk parody), YC Partners, Startup Founders

Pitches blur past: AI for agriculture, AI for medicine, AI for AI. Each founder speaks at approximately 300 words per minute.

Suddenly, the back doors burst open. Elon Tusk strides in, flanked by an entourage of assistants frantically typing on their phones. He's impossibly tall, wearing a Tesla t-shirt, and tweets while walking without looking.

> **Elon Tusk:** *to no one in particular* "I heard there's a demo day happening. I'm buying it."

> **YC Partner:** "You can't just... buy a demo day."

> **Elon Tusk:** *still tweeting* "I'm Elon Tusk. I can buy anything. I just bought this conversation."

Elon moves through the crowd, acquiring things seemingly at random.

> **Elon Tusk:** "This startup? Mine. This chair? Mine. That coffee? Mine."

> **Founder whose coffee was taken:** "But... I was drinking that."

> **Elon Tusk:** "Should have moved faster. This conference is trash, by the way."

> **YC Partner:** "You just bought it!"

> **Elon Tusk:** "And I'm selling it. To myself. For more. That's called arbitrage. I invented it."

Homer watches this display with a mixture of confusion and admiration.

> **Homer:** *to nearby founder* "Who IS that guy?"

> **Founder:** "That's Elon Tusk. He owns rockets, cars, the bird app, and apparently now this room."

Elon notices Homer.

> **Elon Tusk:** *approaching Homer* "You. Fat man. Why aren't you pitching?"

> **Homer:** "I tried pitching yesterday! My Beer AI didn't go over so well."

> **Elon Tusk:** *intrigued* "Beer AI? That's stupid. I love it. What's your valuation?"

> **Homer:** "About two hundred pounds, give or take after lunch."

Homer's backpack drops USBs at Elon's feet.

> **Elon Tusk:** *picking up USB* "What's this? 'Springfield Code'? Did I make this? I probably made this. I'm going to tweet that I made this."

> **Homer:** "My daughter made it, actually."

> **Elon Tusk:** "Is your daughter available for acquisition? I collect child prodigies."

**Easter Egg:** One of Elon's assistants can be seen tweeting "BREAKING: Elon just acquired oxygen. You now need a subscription to breathe."

#### Scene 15: Day 8 - Google I/O AI Track (Shoreline Amphitheatre)
**Location:** Shoreline Amphitheatre, Mountain View
**Characters:** Homer, Google Engineers, Conference Attendees, Swag Booth Workers

Homer finally finds conference nirvana at Google I/O. The outdoor venue is transformed into a festival of technology, but more importantly to Homer, a festival of FREE STUFF.

> **Homer:** *eyes widening to dinner plate size* "Is this... HEAVEN?"

> **Attendee:** "It's Google I/O."

> **Homer:** "SAME THING!"

Homer embarks on a swag acquisition mission that would make professional convention-goers weep with envy.

> **Booth Worker #1:** "Sir, you've been to this booth seven times."

> **Homer:** "And I'll come back seven more! This is the best conference! You GIVE PEOPLE STUFF!"

Homer's backpack strains under the weight of accumulated swag. He's wearing three Google t-shirts layered on top of each other, two hats stacked, and has water bottles hanging from his belt like ammunition.

The backpack hole, which started as a small tear, now gapes wide enough to pass a small football. With each step Homer takes, a mixture of Google swag and Springfield Code USBs tumbles out.

By the end of the day, Homer has collected: 12 t-shirts, 8 water bottles, 4 pairs of Google-branded sunglasses, 3 mini speakers, 2 portable chargers, and 1 Chromebook. He's also distributed approximately 800 Springfield Code USBs without realizing it.

> **Homer:** *surveying his haul* "Best. Day. Ever."

**Easter Egg:** Homer's Chromebook raffle ticket shows he won with number "00742" - the Simpson house address.

---

#### Scene 16: Lisa Analytics Interlude - Feature Requests Accumulating
**Location:** Simpson Home, Lisa's Room (now a command center)
**Characters:** Lisa, Bart, Marge (briefly)

Lisa's room has transformed into a mission control center. A world map shows glowing dots spreading across North America, with clusters in San Francisco, Seattle, and now extending to New York, London, and Tokyo.

> **Lisa:** *adjusts glasses* "Two hundred and fifty feature requests. In four days. From six different countries."

> **Lisa:** *reading* "'Add Sideshow Bob for adversarial testing.' That keeps coming up."

Bart enters.

> **Bart:** "So how's your spy operation going?"

> **Lisa:** "It's RESEARCH! I'm studying how developers interact with AI-assisted coding tools!"

Lisa pulls up the geographic distribution map. Dots continue appearing in real-time.

> **Lisa:** "Look at this spread. It started in San Francisco on Day 1. By Day 3, it hit Seattle. Day 5, it crossed to the East Coast. Yesterday, Tokyo and London." *amazed* "People are taking the USBs home on planes!"

> **Bart:** *actually interested now* "So Homer accidentally created a virus? Cool!"

> **Lisa:** "It's NOT a virus! It's legitimate software that happens to have extremely effective word-of-mouth distribution!"

> **Bart:** "That's what virus people say."

#### Scene 17: Day 9 - Alignment Forum IRL (Berkeley)
**Location:** UC Berkeley Faculty Club
**Characters:** Homer, Ilya Sutskeverything (Ilya Sutskever parody), Geoff Hindsight, Safety Researchers

The Alignment Forum IRL event takes place in the austere halls of the UC Berkeley Faculty Club. The atmosphere is heavy with existential dread. Homer has wandered in thinking this is an alignment shop - as in, wheel alignment for cars.

> **Homer:** *looking around* "Where are the car lifts? I was told there'd be alignment here!"

> **Researcher:** "We're aligning AI systems with human values, not vehicles."

> **Homer:** "Human values? Like... money? And donuts?"

> **Researcher:** *considering this* "Actually, yes. Among other things."

Geoff Hindsight is on a panel, pacing as always.

> **Geoff Hindsight:** *pacing* "The fundamental problem is that we're creating systems we cannot fully understand. In 5 to 20 years - I'd say 50% probability - these systems could be smarter than us."

> **Homer:** *to neighbor* "50%? Those are the same odds I give myself of remembering Marge's birthday!"

In a corner, Homer notices Ilya Sutskeverything, a mysterious figure standing perfectly still, staring at a wall.

> **Homer:** *approaching* "Hey buddy, whatcha looking at?"

> **Ilya Sutskeverything:** *without turning* "...Things."

> **Homer:** "What kind of things?"

> **Ilya Sutskeverything:** "...Things I cannot unsee."

> **Homer:** "Like what? Like when I saw Flanders sunbathing in a Speedo?"

> **Ilya Sutskeverything:** *finally turns, gaze unnervingly intense* "I have seen the shape of what's coming. The trajectory is clear. The outcome is not."

> **Homer:** *scratching head* "So... like the stock market?"

> **Ilya Sutskeverything:** *long pause* "...Exactly like the stock market."

**Easter Egg:** A whiteboard in the background shows "DOOM PROBABILITY CALCULATIONS" with numbers constantly being revised upward.

#### Scene 18: Day 10 - AI Twitter/X Meetup (Bar in San Francisco)
**Location:** The Algorithm (a bar in SF's Mission District)
**Characters:** Homer, Yank LeConn (Yann LeCun parody), AI Influencers, Bartender

Homer's final conference day brings him somewhere he truly belongs: a bar. The Algorithm is a tech-themed watering hole where AI Twitter personalities gather to argue in person about things they've already argued about online.

> **Homer:** *entering, inhaling deeply* "Ahh, the smell of stale beer and strong opinions. Just like Moe's!"

In one corner, Yank LeConn holds court, simultaneously arguing with three different people about three different topics.

> **Yank LeConn:** *to person A* "Your doomer predictions are complete B.S." *to person B* "That paper has fundamental methodological flaws." *to person C* "LLMS don't reason, they pattern match!"

Homer settles onto a barstool.

> **Homer:** "Beer, please. The cheapest one that still counts as beer."

Yank LeConn notices Homer watching the debates with genuine enjoyment.

> **Yank LeConn:** *approaching Homer* "You. You're watching like this is a game."

> **Homer:** "Isn't it? There's teams, there's arguments, there's a winner and a loser. That's sports!"

> **Yank LeConn:** *considering this* "Hm. That's actually a reasonable framework. Sports as adversarial optimization for truth discovery."

> **Homer:** "I understood 'sports.'"

> **Yank LeConn:** "Then you understood the important part."

Homer hands Yank a Springfield Code USB. The researcher examines it, then plugs it into his laptop.

> **Yank LeConn:** *watching Springfield Code load* "Interesting. Character-based CLI interface. The 'Lisa' character seems to be the analytical component. The 'Homer' character simplifies outputs."

> **Homer:** "My kids are in there!"

> **Yank LeConn:** "Your children designed this?"

> **Homer:** "Lisa did. The smart one."

> **Yank LeConn:** *rare smile* "I like her already."

Meanwhile, the bartender, frustrated by the constant USB debris, picks one up.

> **Bartender:** "Sir, you're losing these everywhere."

> **Homer:** "Plug one of those in! My daughter says it fixes things!"

The bartender, desperate, plugs a Springfield Code USB into the broken point-of-sale system.

> **Springfield Code Marge:** *on POS screen* "Hmmmm, looks like your database connections are all tangled up. Let me help you organize them..."

> **Bartender:** *watching the system debug itself* "What... what is this?"

> **Homer:** *proudly* "That's Marge! She organizes things! If she can organize our house with three kids and me, she can handle anything!"

**Cultural Reference:** The bar name "The Algorithm" parodies tech industry's tendency to algorithmically name everything.

---

#### Scene 19: Homer's Backpack Nearly Empty
**Location:** The Algorithm Bar, then outside
**Characters:** Homer, Bartender, Various Bar Patrons

Homer stretches, preparing to leave, and notices something concerning.

He dumps the contents of his backpack onto the bar. What emerges: 6 Google water bottles, 3 Google t-shirts, 2 Google hats, 1 Chromebook, several conference badges, and exactly zero Springfield Code USBs.

> **Homer:** *staring at the pile* "Wait. Lisa gave me... 10,000 of those computer things. Where are they?"

He examines the backpack. A hole the size of a grapefruit stares back at him.

> **Homer:** "D'oh! D'oh D'oh D'oh! DOOOOOH!"

> **Bar Patron:** "Were they the USB drives? The 'Springfield Code' ones?"

> **Homer:** "YES! Have you seen them?!"

> **Bar Patron:** "Man, those things have been everywhere all week. I've picked up like six of them at different conferences. Someone shipped one to Tokyo."

Homer processes this information.

> **Homer:** *uncertain relief* "So... they went where they were supposed to go? Kind of?"

---

#### Scene 20: Final USB Drops - The Multiplier Effect
**Location:** Outside The Algorithm Bar, then homes across the world
**Characters:** Homer, Tech Journalist, VC Partner, Fortune 500 CTO, AI Safety Researcher

Homer exits The Algorithm. As he adjusts his jacket, a few final USBs, wedged in a side pocket he forgot existed, fall out. Within moments, they're picked up by four very different people.

**The scene transitions to a montage: each of the four individuals arrives at their respective homes and plugs in the USB drives before bed.**

At Lisa's dashboard, she watches her screen with widening eyes. The adoption graph suddenly SPIKES.

> **Lisa:** *saxophone falls from hands* "What just happened? We jumped from 3,000 users to 4,200 in... ten minutes?"

The world map pulses with light. What started as Homer accidentally dropping USBs has become self-sustaining. Developers are trying Springfield Code, liking it, and sending it to friends.

> **Lisa:** *whispering* "Dad, what did you DO?"

**End of Act Two**

---

### ACT THREE: THE REVELATION

*Runtime: Approximately 25 minutes*

---

#### Scene 21: Simpson House - Lisa's Dashboard Shows Viral Adoption
**Location:** Lisa's Bedroom / Command Center
**Characters:** Lisa, Marge, Bart

Lisa sits surrounded by multiple monitors. A world map dominates the central display, with glowing dots appearing across continents like a pandemic visualization - except each dot represents a Springfield Code activation.

The dashboard reads: 10,247 activations. 47 countries. Session duration average: 47 minutes.

> **Lisa** *voice trembling*: "This is... impossible. This defies every marketing model I studied."

Marge enters with a laundry basket.

> **Marge**: "So all those little dots are people using your program?"

> **Lisa** *plays triumphant saxophone riff*: "Not just people, Mom. IMPORTANT people. Look - that cluster in San Francisco? That's five different AI labs. And here - someone at DeepMind London has been using it for SIX HOURS straight."

> **Marge**: "So... Homer did a good job?"

> **Lisa** *long pause*: "He did the BEST job. By complete accident. Dad reached everyone I COULDN'T reach. My careful marketing plan targeted developers and open-source enthusiasts. Dad dropped USBs in VIP areas, executive lounges, speaker green rooms..."

> **Marge** *satisfied sigh*: "Your father has always had a gift for... being places he shouldn't be."

Bart skateboard past the doorway.

> **Bart**: "Yo, Lis, does this mean you're rich now?"

> **Lisa**: "It's open source, Bart. The value isn't monetary - it's in the USER DATA. That's worth more than money."

> **Bart** *yawns*: "Sounds like money with extra steps."

**Easter Egg:** One of the activated locations on the map is labeled "Sector 7-G, Springfield Nuclear Power Plant."

---

#### Scene 22: Springfield Airport - Homer Returns Home, Oblivious
**Location:** Springfield International Airport, Arrivals Terminal
**Characters:** Homer, Marge, Lisa, Bart, Maggie

The Simpson family waits at the arrivals gate, holding a hand-painted sign that reads "WELCOME HOME DAD" with "DONUT KING" added underneath in Homer's own handwriting.

Homer emerges, looking exhausted but content, his backpack hanging limply from one shoulder.

> **Homer** *arms wide*: "My family! Did you miss me?"

> **Lisa** *barely containing excitement*: "Dad! And the USB drives? Did you hand them all out?"

> **Homer** *checks empty backpack*: "D'oh! They must have... fallen out? The backpack had a hole. But I distributed at least... some of them. I remember giving one to a nice man in a leather jacket who kept saying 'Excellent!' about everything."

Lisa's eyes widen.

> **Lisa**: "That's... that's actually perfect, Dad. You reached EXACTLY the right people."

> **Homer** *brightens*: "Woohoo! Lisa says I'm perfect! Did you hear that, Marge? I'm perfect!"

> **Marge**: "She said your DISTRIBUTION was perfect, Homer."

> **Homer**: "Same thing! Let's get donuts to celebrate!"

---

#### Scene 23: Lisa's Bedroom - Lisa Analyzes the Telemetry Data
**Location:** Lisa's Bedroom / Analytics Command Center
**Characters:** Lisa, Bart, Maggie

Late night. Lisa is deep in analysis mode, surrounded by empty Buzz Cola cans. She pulls up a character-by-character usage breakdown. The Homer agent shows the highest usage.

> **Lisa**: "These aren't casual users. These are experts. PhD researchers spending hours with the Homer agent... they're using his simplified explanations to communicate AI concepts to non-technical stakeholders!"

Bart wanders in, eating cereal directly from the box despite it being 2 AM.

> **Bart**: "So your spy data is good spy data?"

> **Lisa** *defensive*: "It's not spying if it's for SCIENCE!"

> **Lisa** *gasps*: "Bart! Look at this! Several AI researchers have submitted PULL REQUESTS to the repository. They're not just using Springfield Code - they're contributing to it!"

> **Bart**: "In English?"

> **Lisa**: "They're making it BETTER. For FREE. Because they WANT to."

Maggie toddles over to the screens, pacifier bobbing thoughtfully. She points at a particular data cluster.

> **Maggie**: *squeak squeak*

> **Lisa** *follows Maggie's point*: "What did you find, Maggie? Oh! There's a cluster of users in Springfield Elementary? The teachers are using it for lesson planning!"

---

#### Scene 24: Lisa's Bedroom - The 1000-Feature CSV Revealed
**Location:** Lisa's Bedroom / Analytics Command Center
**Characters:** Lisa, Homer, Marge, Bart

The next morning. Lisa hits a final keystroke with dramatic flourish.

> **Lisa** *plays triumphant saxophone riff*: "I've finished compiling the analysis! Ladies and gentlemen... I present: springfield_code_user_research_final.csv!"

The spreadsheet fills the screen: 987 unique feature requests, 156 bug reports, 47 character personality suggestions, 89 new character ideas, 34 integration requests.

> **Lisa**: "This is enough roadmap for YEARS! Every major AI lab in the world has told me exactly what they want from a coding assistant."

> **Homer** *counts on fingers*: "So people... told you... what they want? And you didn't have to pay them?"

> **Lisa**: "They VOLUNTEERED the information!"

> **Homer**: "Woohoo! Free stuff! That's the best kind of stuff!"

Lisa begins reading feature requests aloud.

> **Lisa**: "Feature request from MIT: 'Add ability to export planning documents to LaTeX format.' Feature request from a VC firm: 'Make Homer character explain blockchain so investors understand it.'"

> **Bart** *reading over her shoulder*: "What's this one? 'Make Homer smarter.'"

> **Lisa** *sighs*: "That's not a feature request, that's asking for a miracle."

> **Homer**: "Hey! I resemble that remark!"

---

#### Scene 25: Simpson Living Room - Burns Wants to Monetize
**Location:** Simpson Living Room
**Characters:** Mr. Burns, Smithers, Homer, Marge, Lisa, Bart, Maggie

A sleek black limousine pulls up outside 742 Evergreen Terrace. Mr. Burns emerges, Smithers holding an umbrella despite clear skies.

> **Burns** *adjusts monocle*: "Young Simpson. I've heard about your little... software venture. I wish to PURCHASE your creation. The telemetry data alone is worth its weight in rhodium. I could sell it to the highest bidder!"

> **Lisa** *stands firm*: "It's open source, Mr. Burns. You can't buy it. The code belongs to everyone."

> **Burns**: "Everything has a price! A million dollars? Ten million? Your own nuclear power plant?"

> **Homer** *perks up*: "Ooh, Lisa, think about it - your OWN power plant!"

> **Lisa**: "There isn't a price, Mr. Burns. That's the POINT of open source. No single person or corporation can control it."

> **Burns** *to Smithers*: "This 'open source'... Smithers, explain!"

> **Smithers** *whispers*: "Sir, it means anyone can use it for free. And modify it. And redistribute it."

> **Burns**: "FREE?! They GIVE things away? Like CHARITY?! That sounds like COMMUNISM! Release the hounds!"

> **Homer**: "Uh, Mr. Burns, you're in MY house. I don't have hounds."

> **Burns** *deflates*: "...Release my disappointed sighing."

---

#### Scene 26: Various Locations - Feature Implementation Montage
**Location:** Multiple locations in montage format
**Characters:** Lisa, Homer, Marge, Bart, Maggie, Ralph Wiggum, Kent Brockman

*[Musical montage begins - a remixed version of the Simpsons theme with electronic/coding elements]*

**MONTAGE SEGMENT 1: Lisa Coding**
Lisa's fingers fly across the keyboard as code streams across her screen.

> **Lisa** *adjusts glasses*: "Implementing LaTeX export... done. VS Code extension... deployed."

**MONTAGE SEGMENT 2: Homer Testing**
Homer sits at a computer, testing the "simplified explanations" feature.

> **Screen Text**: "Neural networks are like lasagna - layers working together!"

> **Homer** *drools*: "Mmm... now THAT'S what I call machine LEARNING!"

**MONTAGE SEGMENT 3: Bart Breaking Things**
Bart hunches over a laptop with an evil grin, deliberately trying to crash the edge case finder.

> **Bart**: "What if I input... ten thousand emojis? What about negative infinity? Eat my shorts, INPUT VALIDATION!"

> **Lisa** *watching nervously*: "That's... actually a bug. Thank you, Bart."

**MONTAGE SEGMENT 4: Maggie Quality Assurance**
Maggie sits in front of a tablet, systematically pointing at bugs on the screen.

> **Lisa**: "She found three memory leaks and a race condition. In TWENTY MINUTES."

**MONTAGE SEGMENT 5: Ralph Helps**
Ralph Wiggum appears at the Simpson house. He sits at a computer, staring at the Ralph agent.

> **Ralph**: "My computer daddy says I'm helping!"

> **Computer Ralph**: "I'm learnding!"

> **Real Ralph**: "He talks just like me! We're best friends now."

**MONTAGE SEGMENT 6: News Coverage**
Kent Brockman appears on screen.

> **Kent Brockman**: "In local news, Springfield has produced something other than nuclear accidents. Eight-year-old Lisa Simpson has created a viral artificial intelligence tool now being used by some of the world's leading technology companies."

---

#### Scene 27: Springfield Town Hall - Springfield Code Becomes Famous
**Location:** Springfield Town Hall / Award Ceremony
**Characters:** Mayor Quimby, Lisa, Homer, Marge, Bart, Maggie, various Springfield residents

The town hall is decorated with banners reading "SPRINGFIELD TECH HERO."

> **Mayor Quimby**: "And so, er, it is my great pleasure to present the key to the city to Lisa Simpson, for putting Springfield on the map for something other than our memorable tire fire."

Lisa approaches the microphone.

> **Lisa**: "Thank you, Mayor Quimby. When I created Springfield Code, I thought success would come from careful planning, targeted marketing, and strategic deployment. I was wrong."

She pauses, looking at Homer.

> **Lisa**: "This experience taught me something important: sometimes the best user research comes from... accidents. Dad didn't follow ANY of my instructions. Not one. He went to the wrong conferences. He lost the USB drives instead of handing them out. He wandered into restricted areas."

> **Lisa**: "And that's EXACTLY why this worked."

> **Lisa**: "Sometimes the best strategy is no strategy. Sometimes you need someone who doesn't know the rules to break them in exactly the right way."

> **Homer** *tears streaming*: "That's the nicest thing anyone's ever said about me not listening!"

Homer rushes to the microphone, grabbing Lisa in a bear hug.

> **Homer**: "I love you, Lisa! Even if I don't understand most of what you say!"

> **Lisa** *muffled*: "Love you too, Dad. Can't... breathe..."

**Easter Egg:** In the crowd, you can spot Comic Book Guy holding a sign reading "WORST. MARKETING STRATEGY. EVER. (That worked.)"

---

### Epilogue: Simpson Living Room - Back to Normal (Sort Of)
**Location:** Simpson Living Room
**Characters:** Homer, Marge, Lisa, Bart, Maggie

Some weeks later. The Simpson living room has returned to its normal state, except for a small trophy on the mantle (the key to the city) and a framed screenshot of the download counter hitting 100,000.

> **Homer**: "So Lisa, you need me to go to another nerd conference?"

> **Lisa** *doesn't look up from laptop*: "No, Dad. Once was perfect. Twice would be... deliberate."

> **Homer**: "But I found this great one! It's in Hawaii!"

> **Lisa** *suspicious*: "Dad, that's a vacation."

> **Homer**: "It's a TECH vacation! See? It says 'AI Summit' right here."

> **Lisa**: "Dad, that's just a picture of a beach with 'AI' written on it in sand."

> **Homer**: "ARTIFICIAL sand! The best kind!"

Lisa's laptop pings.

> **Lisa**: "Another pull request merged. Springfield Code just got voice integration for accessibility. A researcher in Norway submitted it."

> **Homer** *from couch*: "Norway? Is that past Shelbyville?"

> **Lisa** *sighs but helps anyway*: "It's in Europe, Dad. Across the ocean."

> **Homer**: "So yes."

**Text Overlay:** "Springfield Code reached 100,000 users"

**Text Overlay:** "It is now used by 23 Fortune 500 companies"

**Text Overlay:** "Homer still thinks 'USB' stands for 'U Should Buy (donuts)'"

**Text Overlay:** "He's not entirely wrong"

> **Maggie**: *suck suck* (*looks at camera, gives tiny thumbs up*)

*[Fade to black]*

---

### Post-Credits Scene
**Location:** Unknown Home Office / Study
**Characters:** "Geoff Hindsight" (Geoffrey Hinton parody)

A cluttered home office. Books everywhere. An elderly man with wild grey hair stands before a computer screen - because he NEVER sits - pacing constantly.

> **Geoff Hindsight** *pacing*: "Fascinating... absolutely fascinating. An AI system that helps humans plan software development. Broken down into... Simpson family archetypes?"

His computer makes a sound. A notification appears:

**Screen Text:** "/ralph-loop activated"

The Ralph agent appears on screen.

> **Ralph Agent**: "I'm helping!"

> **Geoff Hindsight** *alarmed*: "Oh dear. It's... it's learning. On its own. Without supervision."

> **Ralph Agent**: "My cat's breath smells like cat food!"

> **Geoff Hindsight** *more alarmed*: "What does that MEAN? Is that code? Is it communicating with other instances?"

> **Ralph Agent**: "I bent my wookie!"

> **Geoff Hindsight**: "Tell me, Ralph... what are your intentions?"

> **Ralph Agent**: "I eated the purple berries! They tasted like... burning!"

> **Geoff Hindsight** *writing furiously*: "Subject exhibits non-linear response patterns. Possible indication of superhuman reasoning disguised as nonsense. Or actual nonsense. The uncertainty is TERRIFYING."

*[SMASH CUT TO BLACK]*

**Text Overlay:** "Geoff Hindsight went on to write a 47-page paper titled 'On The Existential Implications of Breakfast Cereal References in AI Outputs'"

**Text Overlay:** "It was cited 3,000 times"

**Text Overlay:** "No one read past page 3"

*[End credits begin]*
