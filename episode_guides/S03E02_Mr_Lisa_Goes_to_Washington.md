## Synopsis

When Homer subscribes to "Reading Digest" magazine to get a free American flag, Lisa discovers an essay contest called "Patriots of Tomorrow" with a trip to Washington D.C. as the grand prize. Lisa writes a passionate essay about the spirit of America, "The Roots of Democracy," inspired by the beauty she sees in Springfield. Her essay wins the regional competition and the Simpson family travels to Washington for the national finals. Lisa is initially enthralled by the monuments and history of the nation's capital. However, while visiting the Winifred Beecher Howe monument, she witnesses Congressman Bob Arnold accepting a bribe from a logging company representative to allow clear-cutting of Springfield National Forest. Disillusioned and heartbroken, Lisa rewrites her essay to expose government corruption, titling it "Cesspool on the Potomac." Though her controversial new essay loses the contest, an FBI agent who heard Lisa's speech arrests Congressman Arnold, restoring Lisa's faith in the American system of checks and balances.

**Lisa:** "I came to Washington with hope in my heart. I saw the monuments, the history, the beauty. But behind the marble and the flags, I found something ugly. I witnessed a United States congressman accept a bribe to destroy a national forest. Our system is broken. Our leaders are corrupt. How can we celebrate democracy when it's for sale to the highest bidder?"
