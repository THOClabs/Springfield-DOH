## 2. Synopsis

In a parody of the classic film "All About Eve," Lisa becomes Krusty the Clown's newest assistant and eventually steals his spotlight. The episode begins at the 38th Annual Springfield Media Awards, where Lisa Simpson wins the prestigious Entertainer of the Year Award. Through a flashback narrated by Sideshow Mel, the story reveals how Lisa rose from being an unpaid intern on Krusty's show to becoming a television star with her own program, ultimately replacing Krusty's show entirely. However, a visit to the Hall of Fame reveals the dark side of fleeting celebrity, prompting Lisa to make a selfless decision to restore Krusty to his former glory.

Meanwhile, Homer and Bart bond over their newfound hobby of coin collecting. Their quest to complete their coin album leads them on a search for a rare 1917 "Kissing Lincolns" misminted penny that appears to show Abraham Lincoln kissing himself. After losing the penny to Mr. Burns at an auction for ten million dollars, Homer cleverly tricks Burns into giving him the rare coin as change for a gumball.
