## Synopsis

After Homer forgets to pick up Bart from soccer practice during a rainstorm, leaving him stranded for hours, Bart becomes furious with his neglectful father. In retaliation, Bart joins the "Bigger Brothers" program, pretending to be an orphan whose father abandoned him, and is paired with Tom, a motorcycle-riding fighter pilot who becomes the cool father figure Bart always wanted. When Homer discovers Bart's deception, he exacts revenge by becoming a Bigger Brother himself to a real orphan named Pepi. The rivalry between Homer and Tom escalates into one of the most epic fights in Simpsons history, raging across Springfield before Homer ends up with his spine bent over a fire hydrant. Meanwhile, Lisa develops an expensive addiction to the Corey Hotline, running up a $378.53 phone bill listening to recorded messages from the teen idol.
