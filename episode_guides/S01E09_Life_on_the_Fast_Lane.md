**Location:** Springfield Mall
**Characters:** Homer

Homer suddenly realizes he has forgotten Marge's 34th birthday. In a panic, he rushes through the Springfield Mall looking for a gift.

He spots a bowling ball and, despite the gift being entirely for himself, decides to buy it. He has his own name - "HOMER" - engraved on it.

#### Scene 2: Simpson Home - Birthday Dinner

The family gathers to celebrate Marge's birthday. Bart and Lisa present thoughtful gifts:
- **Bart:** A bottle of French perfume
- **Lisa:** A macaroni-and-glue portrait of Marge as the Mona Lisa

Marge is touched by the children's gifts.

Homer then presents his "gift" - the bowling ball. As he hands it over, the ball breaks through the bottom of its box and squashes Marge's birthday cake.

Marge examines the ball and sees "HOMER" engraved on it. She's deeply offended.

### ACT TWO

Over several lessons, Jacques slowly seduces Marge:

- He teaches her proper form with intimate physical contact
- He's sophisticated and attentive - everything Homer isn't

Marge finds herself increasingly attracted to Jacques despite her loyalty to Homer.

**Production Note:** Albert Brooks improvised almost all his dialogue, producing over three hours of material. Julie Kavner's genuine laughter at Brooks' improvisations was kept in the episode.

#### Scene 6: The Singing Sirloin - Brunch Date
**Location:** The Singing Sirloin restaurant
**Characters:** Marge, Jacques, Helen Lovejoy

Jacques invites Marge to brunch. She agrees, rationalizing it as just a friendly meal.

The date goes well - Jacques is charming and makes Marge feel special. However, they're spotted by Helen Lovejoy, the gossipy preacher's wife, who seems delighted to catch Marge with another man.

Marge and Jacques deflect Helen's prying by pretending to discuss bowling theory.

After Helen leaves, Jacques makes his move: he invites Marge to his apartment the next day.

As Marge drives, she comes to a literal fork in the road:
- **Left:** Jacques' apartment
- **Right:** Springfield Nuclear Power Plant (Homer's workplace)

Marge agonizes over her decision. She thinks about her lifetime commitment to Homer - their marriage, their children, their history together.
