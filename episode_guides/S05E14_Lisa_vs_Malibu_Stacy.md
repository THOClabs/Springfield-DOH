## Synopsis

When a new talking Malibu Stacy doll is released spouting sexist phrases, Lisa is outraged by the gender stereotypes it perpetuates. After the doll company dismisses her complaints, Lisa tracks down Stacy Lovell, the original creator of Malibu Stacy, with help from Smithers (who owns the world's largest Malibu Stacy collection). Together, Lisa and the disillusioned Stacy create "Lisa Lionheart," a feminist alternative doll with empowering messages. However, when Lisa Lionheart launches, it's immediately overshadowed by the company's counter-move: the same old Malibu Stacy with a new hat. Though nearly everyone chooses the new hat version, one little girl selects Lisa Lionheart, giving Lisa hope that she made a difference. Meanwhile, Grampa gives away his inheritance and takes a job at Krusty Burger to feel young and relevant.

The generational disconnect provides comic relief.

**Location:** Springfield Mall - Toy Store
**Characters:** Lisa, Stacy, Smithers, shoppers

Just as the crowd approaches Lisa Lionheart, a store employee wheels out a cart.

It's filled with "new" Malibu Stacy dolls.

The only difference: she has a new hat.

Lisa appeals to the crowd:

**Lisa:** "Wait! Don't be fooled. She's just a regular Malibu Stacy with a stupid, cheap hat."

**Lisa:** "She still embodies all the awful stereotypes she did before!"

The crowd pauses... then turns toward the Malibu Stacy display.

**Smithers:** "But she's got a new hat!"

The joke undercuts the sentiment, but Lisa's victory stands.

#### Scene 14: Grampa's Realization
**Location:** Krusty Burger / Simpson Home
**Characters:** Grampa, Simpson Family

Grampa concludes his Krusty Burger employment.

He realizes that trying to be young isn't the answer.

He accepts his generational position, even if it means complaining about youth.

#### Scene 15: Resolution
**Location:** 742 Evergreen Terrace
**Characters:** Simpson Family

The family reflects on the events.

Lisa has learned that change is difficult but worth fighting for.
