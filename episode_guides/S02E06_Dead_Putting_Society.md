## Synopsis

When Homer visits Ned Flanders' impressive rec room and perfect family life, his jealousy boils over into an angry confrontation. After Ned writes an apology letter that only fuels Homer's resentment, the rivalry escalates when both Bart and Todd Flanders enter a miniature golf tournament. Homer bets Ned that the loser's father must mow the winner's lawn wearing his wife's Sunday dress.

#### Scene 2: Flanders Home - The Rumpus Room
**Location:** 740 Evergreen Terrace - Basement
**Characters:** Homer, Ned, Maude, Rod, Todd

Homer enters Ned's basement and is immediately envious. The Flanders have:

**Notable First:** First appearance of Maude and Rod Flanders.

#### Scene 3: Homer's Outburst
**Location:** Flanders Home - Basement
**Characters:** Homer, Ned

Homer's jealousy boils over. He accuses Ned of showing off and being a hypocrite. Unable to articulate his real grievances, Homer lashes out irrationally.

Ned, shocked and hurt, asks Homer to leave.

Homer storms out.

#### Scene 4: Ned's Guilt
**Location:** Flanders Home / Church
**Characters:** Ned, Reverend Lovejoy

Ned feels terrible about the confrontation, even though Homer was the aggressor. He consults Reverend Lovejoy for spiritual guidance on how to handle his "outburst."

Lovejoy advises Ned to write an apology letter.

**Production Note:** This episode establishes Ned's early characterization as genuinely kind and troubled by conflict, before he became more of a caricature in later seasons.

#### Scene 5: The Apology Letter
**Location:** Simpson Home
**Characters:** Homer, Marge

Homer receives Ned's heartfelt apology letter. Rather than being touched, Homer interprets it as condescending and becomes even more enraged.

Marge tries to calm Homer down, but his irrational hatred of Ned only intensifies.

---

### ACT TWO

#### Scene 6: Sir Putts-a-Lot Mini Golf Course
**Location:** Sir Putts-a-Lot Mini Golf
**Characters:** Homer, Bart, Ned, Todd, Marge, Lisa

The Simpsons and Flanders both visit the local miniature golf course. Homer notices a flyer for an upcoming mini-golf tournament with a $50 first prize.

Both Bart and Todd decide to enter the competition.

Homer sees this as an opportunity to prove Simpson superiority over the Flanders.

#### Scene 7: The Bet
**Location:** Sir Putts-a-Lot / Simpson Home
**Characters:** Homer, Ned

Homer challenges Ned to a bet: the father of the losing boy must mow the other's lawn while wearing his wife's Sunday dress.

Ned, uncomfortable with the wager, reluctantly agrees after Homer pressures him.

The terms are written down and signed.

#### Scene 8: Training Begins - Homer's Approach
**Location:** Simpson Home / Mini Golf Course
**Characters:** Homer, Bart

Homer attempts to train Bart using aggressive, Vince Lombardi-style sports motivation:
- Yelling
- Pressure
- Demanding perfection

Bart struggles under Homer's intense coaching style. The training goes poorly.

#### Scene 9: Lisa Intervenes
**Location:** Simpson Home
**Characters:** Lisa, Bart

Lisa observes Bart's struggles and offers to help. She takes a more intellectual approach, going to the library to research golf techniques and Eastern philosophy.

**Lisa:** "It's times like these that I'm thankful Dad has little to no interest in almost everything I do."

#### Scene 10: The Library
**Location:** Springfield Public Library
**Characters:** Lisa, Bart, librarians

Lisa and Bart visit the library, where everyone knows Lisa by name. They research:

- Taoism
- Zen meditation
- Focus techniques

Lisa determines that mini-golf is mostly about geometry and concentration.

---

### ACT THREE

#### Scene 11: Zen Training
**Location:** Simpson Home / Mini Golf Course
**Characters:** Lisa, Bart

Lisa trains Bart using Zen principles:
- Meditation sessions
- Learning to clear his mind
- Focusing on breathing

**Lisa:** "Embrace nothingness. Become like an uncarved stone."
**Bart:** "Done."
**Lisa:** "You're just pretending to know what I'm talking about."
**Bart:** (doesn't disagree)

#### Scene 12: The Koan
**Location:** Simpson Home
**Characters:** Lisa, Bart

Lisa presents Bart with a classic Zen koan:

**Lisa:** "What is the sound of one hand clapping?"

Bart proceeds to demonstrate by clapping his fingers against his palm on one hand - technically correct but missing the point.

**Lisa:** (frustrated) "There IS no answer. It's supposed to clear your mind of conscious thought."

#### Scene 13: Karate Kid Training
**Location:** Simpson Backyard
**Characters:** Lisa, Bart

Lisa has Bart practice balance and focus using "Karate Kid" style training:
- Balancing on a trash can
- Crane position stance
- Concentration exercises

Bart's skills improve dramatically.

#### Scene 14: Course Memorization
**Location:** Sir Putts-a-Lot Mini Golf
**Characters:** Lisa, Bart

Lisa drills Bart on every hole of the course:

**Lisa:** "Eighth hole."
**Bart:** "Aim for the octopus' third tentacle."
**Lisa:** "Twelfth hole."
**Bart:** "Bank it off the pink tombstone."
**Lisa:** "Nirvana."
**Bart:** "State of bliss attained through the extinction of the self."

Bart is ready.

#### Scene 15: Tournament Day
**Location:** Sir Putts-a-Lot Mini Golf
**Characters:** Homer, Marge, Bart, Lisa, Ned, Maude, Todd, Rod, crowd, announcer

The big tournament arrives. The Simpsons and Flanders are both in attendance, with Homer and Ned increasingly nervous about their bet.

Bart and Todd both perform exceptionally well, advancing through the rounds.

#### Scene 16: The Final Match
**Location:** Sir Putts-a-Lot Mini Golf - 18th Hole
**Characters:** Bart, Todd, Homer, Ned, crowd

Bart and Todd reach the final hole in a dead heat. They're perfectly matched.

Both boys realize they're equally skilled. Rather than continuing the bitter competition their fathers have manufactured, Bart and Todd make a decision together.

**Bart & Todd:** They agree to call it a tie and split the prize money.

The crowd is touched by this display of sportsmanship.

**Announcer:** "This is the most stirring display of gallantry and sportsmanship since Mountbatten gave India back to the Punjabs."

#### Scene 17: The Bet's Consequences
**Location:** Simpson/Flanders Homes - Front Lawns
**Characters:** Homer, Ned, Marge, Maude, families

Because the bet specified "the father of the boy who does NOT win," and neither boy technically won outright, BOTH Homer AND Ned must fulfill the terms.

Both fathers must mow each other's lawn while wearing their wife's Sunday dress.

Homer is mortified and furious.

Ned, however, actually enjoys the experience and finds it liberating.

**Homer:** (disgusted by Ned's cheerfulness)
