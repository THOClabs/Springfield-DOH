Lisa eagerly identifies two:
1. His revolver - The Colt revolver wasn't invented until 1835
2. His Texas belt buckle - Texas didn't become a state until 1845

She hesitates on the third clue.

**Mr. Bergstrom:** The third is that he appears to be Jewish. He cheerfully explains: "For the record, there were a lot of Jewish cowboys in the Old West. Big guys, who were great shots and spent money freely."

#### Scene 10: Election Day
**Location:** Springfield Elementary School - Mrs. Krabappel's Classroom
**Characters:** Bart, Martin, Mrs. Krabappel, classmates

It's election day in Bart's classroom.

Bart is so confident of victory that he throws a premature victory party during recess instead of voting.

All of Bart's supporters, including Milhouse and Lewis, join the party rather than casting their ballots.

When the votes are counted, the results are shocking:
- Martin Prince: 2 votes
- Bart Simpson: 0 votes

Martin wins! The only people who voted were Martin himself and Wendell.

Bart is stunned. He lost because literally none of his supporters bothered to vote.

Lisa desperately searches for Mr. Bergstrom. She finds him at the train station, about to board a train.

**Mr. Bergstrom:** "That's the problem with being middle-class. Anybody who really cares will abandon you for those who need it more."

He explains that he's a substitute teacher - his life is transient. He's needed in Capital City, where he'll work near the government housing projects with children who have even fewer resources than Lisa.

Lisa is heartbroken.

Before boarding the train, Mr. Bergstrom hands Lisa a folded note. He tells her that whenever she feels alone and needs encouragement, the contents of this note are all she needs to know.

Mr. Bergstrom boards the train and departs.

Lisa unfolds the note. It reads simply: **"You are Lisa Simpson."**

#### Scene 13: Homer Comforts Lisa

Later that night, Homer goes to Lisa's room.

He sits on her bed and admits he doesn't know what to say. He confesses that he's never lost someone special before and can't imagine how she feels.

Despite herself, Lisa begins to laugh.

Homer continues his buffoonery, and Lisa's laughter grows. The tension breaks.
