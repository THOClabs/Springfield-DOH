## Synopsis

After burning his tongue at a carnival, Homer develops a heightened sense of taste that makes normal food unbearable. He can only eat the bland cafeteria food at Springfield Elementary. While eating there, Homer observes "helicopter parents" and decides to closely monitor Bart's academic performance and Lisa's social life. Homer takes over Bart's balsa wood model project (building Westminster Abbey) and gives Lisa aggressive advice on making friends. Meanwhile, Marge discovers a hidden sauna in the basement and becomes addicted to using it.
