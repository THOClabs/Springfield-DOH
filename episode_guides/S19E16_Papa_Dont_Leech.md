## Synopsis

When Springfield goes broke, the town begins collecting millions in unpaid back taxes from its residents. The only person who hasn't paid is Lurleen Lumpkin, the country music star Homer once managed. Lurleen returns to Springfield homeless and unable to pay her debts because all her money goes to her ex-husbands. Marge decides to help Lurleen by tracking down her deadbeat father who abandoned her 30 years ago, hoping a reunion will solve Lurleen's problems. However, things take a turn when Royce Lumpkin steals one of Lurleen's songs and sells it to The Dixie Chicks.

## Main Plot Summary

The episode begins with Mayor Quimby discovering that Springfield is broke. Homer suggests faking a natural disaster to get federal relief funds, but the government officials who arrive turn out to be impostors, pushing the town further into debt. Lisa discovers that Springfield has millions in uncollected taxes and proposes the town collect them from residents.

Kent Brockman reports that everyone has paid their back taxes except country music star Lurleen Lumpkin, whom Homer once managed and who had fallen in love with him. The town searches for her, and Homer finds Lurleen hiding in his car. He takes her to the Simpson house, but Marge, still angry from their previous encounter, initially drives her away. When Marge discovers that Lurleen is homeless, she brings her back.

Lurleen cooks a barbecue for the family, but police arrest her and take her to court. She pleads that she can't pay her taxes because all her money goes to her ex-husbands (all of whom strongly resemble Homer), but Judge Snyder orders her to pay. Lurleen becomes depressed, and the family hears her singing through the vent about her long-lost father.

Marge decides that finding Lurleen's father will solve her problems. After an exhaustive search, Marge tracks down Royce Lumpkin, the man who abandoned Lurleen. She convinces him to make amends with his daughter. However, Royce reunites with Lurleen just long enough to steal one of her new songs and sell it to The Dixie Chicks.

- **The Dixie Chicks:** The episode features a self-deprecating reference to The Dixie Chicks' 2003 controversy when Natalie Maines made critical comments about President George W. Bush. In a reverse of their real-life anti-war stance, the lyrics they sing in the episode are nationalistic in nature
- **"Daddy's Back" Song:** The song sung by the Simpsons and Lurleen mentions Harry Potter and Estée Lauder

### Film and Television
- **The Sopranos:** Homer's dream about being in a car crash with Grampa is an almost shot-for-shot remake of a scene from The Sopranos episode "Kennedy and Heidi" (2007), where Homer suffocates Abe in a manner similar to Tony suffocating Christopher
- **Back to the Future:** When Lurleen sings about her father leaving her, Maggie holds the telephone receiver towards the music, mirroring a similar scene from the 1985 film
- **The Muppet Show:** Lurleen is shown making a guest appearance on The Muppet Show, singing "Bunk with Me Tonight," which gets Kermit into trouble with Miss Piggy
- **Colonel Homer:** The episode serves as a sequel to the Season 3 episode "Colonel Homer," marking Lurleen's first major return (though she had brief cameos in "Marge vs. the Monorail" and "Team Homer")

### Other References

## Themes and Analysis

### Marge's Growth
This episode shows significant character development for Marge. Despite her previous jealousy and anger toward Lurleen from "Colonel Homer," Marge takes on a compassionate role and actively works to help her. This demonstrates Marge's ability to move past personal conflicts when she sees someone in genuine need.

### Financial Responsibility
The episode touches on themes of taxation, financial responsibility, and the consequences of debt through both Springfield's municipal crisis and Lurleen's personal financial troubles.

### Celebrity and Exploitation
Lurleen's story arc highlights how fame doesn't guarantee financial security, especially when surrounded by people who exploit success for personal gain (her ex-husbands and father).
