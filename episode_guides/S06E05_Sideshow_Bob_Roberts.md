## Synopsis

Sideshow Bob is released from prison after a campaign by Springfield's conservative Republicans, led by local talk radio host Birch Barlow. With their backing, Bob runs for mayor against the incumbent "Diamond" Joe Quimby. Despite polls showing Quimby ahead, Bob wins in a landslide. As mayor, Bob immediately begins targeting Bart, condemning the Simpson home for demolition. Lisa and Bart investigate and discover Bob rigged the election using votes from dead people and pets in the Springfield Cemetery. They expose the fraud in court, and Bob is sent back to prison, but not before delivering his famous Gilbert and Sullivan-style confession.
