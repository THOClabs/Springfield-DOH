## Synopsis

Homer makes a disastrous investment, losing the family's savings. Desperate to pay the mortgage, he secretly borrows money from the only people willing to lend: Marge's sisters, Patty and Selma. They hold this debt over Homer, forcing him to wait on them and humiliating him at every turn. Homer is forbidden from telling Marge, as the twins know she'd take his side. Meanwhile, Bart is forced to choose a PE activity and ends up in ballet class, discovering he has surprising natural talent. Homer eventually repays the debt by becoming a chauffeur, and when he saves Patty and Selma from losing their jobs by taking the blame for their smoking, they agree to call it even.
