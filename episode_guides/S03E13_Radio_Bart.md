## Synopsis

On his tenth birthday, Bart receives a disappointing gift - a "Superstar Celebrity Microphone" that can transmit through AM radio frequencies. After discovering its potential, Bart uses it for increasingly elaborate pranks, including convincing Rod and Todd Flanders that God is speaking to them. His ultimate prank involves lowering the microphone into an abandoned well and pretending to be a trapped boy named "Timmy O'Toole." The hoax captures the attention of all Springfield, spawning a media circus, charity concert, and a song performed by Sting. When Lisa discovers the truth and Bart realizes his "Property of Bart Simpson" label is on the radio in the well, he tries to retrieve it - only to fall in and become genuinely trapped. The townspeople, furious at being deceived, initially refuse to help, but Homer leads a community digging effort that ultimately saves Bart.

## The Song: "We're Sending Our Love Down the Well"

Sting performs this charity song parody at the benefit concert:

The song satirizes 1980s charity super-songs like "We Are the World" and "Do They Know It's Christmas?"

It captures the performative nature of celebrity charity efforts.

The crowd's emotional response contrasts with the song's ultimate meaninglessness (since "Timmy" doesn't exist).
