## Synopsis

When Lisa notices there are no baby pictures of Maggie in the family photo album, Homer tells the story of Maggie's birth through flashback. In 1993, Homer had finally paid off all his debts and achieved his dream of quitting the power plant to work at a bowling alley. But after a romantic celebration with Marge, she becomes pregnant with their third child. Unable to support a family of five on a bowling alley salary, Homer is forced to beg Mr. Burns for his old job back. Burns rehires him but installs a demotivational plaque reading "Don't Forget: You're Here Forever." The episode ends with one of television's most touching reveals: Homer has placed Maggie's photos around the plaque so it reads "Do It For Her."
