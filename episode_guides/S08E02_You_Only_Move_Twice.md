## Synopsis

When Waylon Smithers turns down a lucrative job offer from the Globex Corporation in Cypress Creek, Mr. Burns offers the position to Homer as the next longest-tenured employee. Homer accepts, and the entire Simpson family relocates to the seemingly perfect planned community. Homer's new boss, Hank Scorpio, is friendly, generous, and genuinely appreciative - everything Mr. Burns isn't. However, unbeknownst to Homer, Scorpio is actually a supervillain bent on world domination. While Homer thrives in his new position, each family member struggles: Marge is bored in her self-cleaning house and turns to wine, Bart is placed in remedial classes, and Lisa suffers from severe allergies to the local flora. When the family demands to return to Springfield, Homer must choose between his dream job and his family's happiness. He resigns just as government forces assault Scorpio's compound. As a parting gift, Scorpio conquers the East Coast and gives Homer the Denver Broncos - though Homer had wanted the Dallas Cowboys.
