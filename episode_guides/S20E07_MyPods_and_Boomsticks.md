## PLOT SYNOPSIS

### Main Plot: The Terrorist Misunderstanding

The episode begins the day after Christmas at the Springfield Mall, which has already moved on to Martin Luther King Jr. Day, featuring children sitting on an MLK impersonator's lap similar to a Mall Santa.

The Simpson family visits the Mapple Store at the mall. On the way home, Bart narrowly escapes punishment and befriends a Muslim boy named Bashir from Jordan.

Homer becomes suspicious of Bart's new Muslim friend and invites Bashir's family over for dinner to investigate their supposed anti-American sentiments. After already offending Bashir and his family at dinner, Homer goes to their home to apologize.

Instead of apologizing, Homer snoops around their house à la Jack Bauer from "24" and uncovers what he believes to be a terrorist plot to blow up the Springfield Mall. Homer tries to warn the residents of Springfield about an impending disaster that he winds up causing himself.

### Subplot: Lisa's MyPod Debt

Lisa gets her very own MyPod at the Mapple Store. Bart interrupts an announcement from Steve Mobbs with his own voiceover, causing pandemonium to break loose in the store.

Lisa runs up a $1,200 bill from downloading songs and receives a huge "MyBill" (a reference to the infamous 300-page iPhone bill). She later meets with Steve Mobbs himself about her bill at Mapple headquarters deep below the sea.

Mobbs not only denies her a refund but puts her to work it off in an undignified way. Lisa is reduced to working off her debt by dressing up as a MyPod and handing out leaflets saying "Think Differently."

## TRIVIA

### Episode Firsts & Milestones
- **First episode** of The Simpsons to have Islam portrayed in a large role
- Dan Castellaneta reprises his role as the Genie from the Aladdin TV series, "The Return of Jafar," and Kingdom Hearts video games

### Accidentally Correct Writing
- Although the bin Laden family in the episode originates from Saudi Arabia (not Jordan as stated), the actual bin Laden family is in fact in the construction business - an example of "accidentally correct writing"

### Continuity
- In a later episode "Lisa the Drama Queen," Lisa is shown to still own her MyPod
- Mapple's product line parodies Apple's offerings from the late 2000s when Steve Jobs was still alive, including the iPod (which was discontinued in May 2022)

### Production Notes
- The episode aired the day after Christmas but features the mall already moved on to MLK Day
- The Mapple subplot represents contemporary 2008 technology culture

- Some noted it was "a pretty controversial theme for a Simpsons episode, even if it does feel like it came 5 years too late"

**Mark I. Pinsky (CNN, June 2015):**
- Noted "MyPods and Boomsticks" as a satire of Islam that is "wise, and well within the show's tradition of portraying an unfamiliar faith in a knowing way, with a relatively light hand"

**David Feltmate** (*Drawn to the Gods: Religion in The Simpsons, South Park and Family Guy*):
- Mentioned the episode treats Islam through widely held stereotypes (similar to South Park and Family Guy)
- However, noted "MyPods and Boomsticks" is unique: "the one example in which Islam is hated at the start of the episode but not at the end"
