In retaliation, Homer climbs the Lard Lad statue and steals its giant metal donut, bringing it home.

#### Scene 2: Simpson Home - Night
**Location:** 742 Evergreen Terrace
**Characters:** Homer, Marge

Homer triumphantly brings home the giant metal donut. Marge expresses concern about the theft.

An intense electrical storm strikes Springfield. Lightning hits various giant advertising statues throughout the city, bringing them to life:

Kent Brockman reports on the chaos from the KBBL news desk, only to be attacked by a giant version of himself.

**Kent Brockman:** Reports on the destruction before being grabbed by his own giant mascot likeness.

The mascots' roars echo through the city, with Lard Lad notably roaring like Godzilla.

#### Scene 6: The Advertising Agency
**Location:** Springfield Advertising Agency
**Characters:** Lisa Simpson, Advertising Executive, Paul Anka

Desperate for a solution, Lisa visits an advertising agency to understand how to stop the mascots.

The advertising executive explains the fundamental nature of advertising:

**Advertising Executive:** "If people stop paying attention to it, pretty soon it goes away."

He suggests creating a jingle to help people ignore the monsters, but admits it would sound better coming from a professional. At that moment, Paul Anka (playing himself) arrives in Springfield.

#### Scene 7: The "Just Don't Look" Song
**Location:** Springfield - Outdoor Stage

## SEGMENT TWO: Nightmare on Evergreen Terrace

### Synopsis
In a parody of "A Nightmare on Elm Street," Groundskeeper Willie attacks the children of Springfield in their dreams after being killed in a freak accident at a PTA meeting. Any injuries inflicted in the dreams manifest in reality, and the children must find a way to stop Willie before he kills them all.

### Scene-by-Scene Breakdown

#### Scene 1: Bart's Nightmare
**Location:** Simpson Backyard (Dream)
**Characters:** Bart Simpson, Santa's Little Helper, Groundskeeper Willie

Bart dreams he is outside playing Frisbee with Santa's Little Helper on a pleasant day. Suddenly, the atmosphere darkens and Groundskeeper Willie appears, transformed into a menacing figure resembling Freddy Krueger.

Bart attempts to flee but Willie corners him and slashes him with the rake.

#### Scene 2: Waking in Terror
**Location:** Bart's Bedroom

**Location:** Springfield Elementary School
**Characters:** Bart, Lisa, Milhouse Van Houten, Nelson Muntz, Sherri, Terri, Martin Prince, Mrs. Krabappel, Principal Skinner

At school, students share their experiences with the nightmare visitor:

**Nelson Muntz:** Was run over with a floor buffer in his dream and has the tire marks to prove it.

**Sherri and Terri:** Have slash marks across their chests identical to Bart's.

**Bart:** Explains that Willie attacked him with a rake.

Principal Skinner dismisses their concerns:

**Principal Skinner:** "There's nothing mysterious about Willie. He simply... disappeared before telling them not to question the bizarre cover-up."

Skinner awkwardly refuses to elaborate on what happened to Willie.

#### Scene 4: Martin's Fatal Nap
**Location:** Springfield Elementary - Classroom
**Characters:** Martin Prince, Mrs. Krabappel, Groundskeeper Willie (in dream), Students

During a test, Martin Prince finishes early and falls asleep at his desk.

In his dream, Willie appears and strangles Martin to death.

In reality, Martin's body freezes in a look of absolute terror as he dies in front of the class. His corpse traumatizes the other students and the kindergarteners who were passing by.

**Mrs. Krabappel:** Reacts in horror to Martin's sudden death.

#### Scene 5: The Backstory Revealed
**Location:** Simpson Home / Flashback to School PTA Meeting
**Characters:** Bart, Lisa, Homer, Marge, Groundskeeper Willie, Principal Skinner, Other Parents

Bart and Lisa investigate what happened to Willie. A flashback reveals the truth:

During a PTA meeting, the school furnace malfunctioned. Groundskeeper Willie became engulfed in flames in the boiler room.

Willie staggered into the PTA meeting, burning alive and screaming for help.

**Groundskeeper Willie:** (on fire) Begs for help from the parents.

The parents, including Homer, were too absorbed in their petty arguments about school issues to help. They brushed Willie off and asked him to wait his turn.

**Homer:** Tells the burning Willie to sit down and wait.

Willie politely took a seat... and burned to death.

As he died, Willie swore revenge:

**Groundskeeper Willie:** "I'll strike where you cannot protect them - in their dreams!"

#### Scene 6: Staying Awake
**Location:** Simpson Home - Kitchen
**Characters:** Bart, Lisa

Bart and Lisa devise a plan to stay awake indefinitely to avoid Willie's attacks. They drink massive amounts of coffee and try various methods to stay alert.

Despite their efforts, exhaustion eventually overtakes them.

#### Scene 7: The Shared Dream
**Location:** Dreamscape - School/Various
**Characters:** Bart, Lisa, Groundskeeper Willie

The children flee through various twisted dream locations as Willie pursues them.

#### Scene 8: Confronting Willie
**Location:** Dreamscape
**Characters:** Bart, Lisa, Maggie, Groundskeeper Willie

Bart and Lisa realize they must confront Willie rather than run. They attempt to fight back within the dream.

#### Scene 9: Maggie's Victory
**Location:** Dreamscape
**Characters:** Maggie Simpson, Groundskeeper Willie

Maggie toddles up to Willie as he plays his bagpipes. She inserts her pacifier into the bagpipe's exhaust pipe, clogging it.

**Groundskeeper Willie:** Explodes in a burst of tartan and dream energy.

The children wake up, believing they are safe.

#### Scene 10: The Bus Ending
**Location:** School Bus
**Characters:** Bart, Lisa, Otto, Groundskeeper Willie

The children ride the school bus, relieved that the nightmare is over.

Suddenly, Willie appears on the bus, seemingly restored.

### Synopsis
While trying to avoid his sisters-in-law Patty and Selma, Homer discovers a portal behind the living room bookcase that leads to the third dimension. Trapped in a computer-generated 3D world, Homer must find a way to escape before the dimension collapses.

### Scene-by-Scene Breakdown

#### Scene 6: Homer's Exploration
**Location:** 3D World

Homer wanders through the 3D world, encountering various objects:

In frustration, Homer throws the cone away. It lands point-first in the center of the dimensional floor.

#### Scene 7: The Collapse Begins
**Location:** 3D World
**Characters:** Homer Simpson (3D)

The cone creates a crack in the dimensional fabric. A swirling black hole/sinkhole begins forming at the center of the 3D world, slowly expanding and drawing everything toward it.

The pull of the singularity grows stronger, dragging Homer toward certain doom.

#### Scene 8: The Rescue Attempt

Bart volunteers to go into the portal and rescue Homer. He is tied to a rope for safety.

**Homer:** Leaps toward Bart's outstretched hand.

Homer falls short and plunges into the black hole.

#### Scene 10: A Better Place
**Location:** Sherman Oaks, California - Real World (Live Action)

**Homer:** Looks around in confusion and fear at the "real" world with its live-action buildings, cars, and people.

**Homer:** "This is the worst place yet!"

Homer wanders down the street, bewildered by reality. He passes real stores and restaurants.

He spots an erotic cake shop ("Erotic Cakes") and his demeanor immediately changes.
