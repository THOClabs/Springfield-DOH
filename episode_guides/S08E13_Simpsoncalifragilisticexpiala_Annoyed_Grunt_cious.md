## Synopsis

When Marge begins losing her hair at an alarming rate due to stress, Dr. Hibbert diagnoses the problem and the Simpson family decides to hire a nanny to handle housework and childcare. After rejecting several unsuitable candidates (including Kearney), a magical woman descends from the sky with a parrot-headed umbrella—Shary Bobbins. The Mary Poppins-esque nanny transforms the Simpson household through song and whimsy, teaching the family valuable lessons and curing Marge's stress-induced hair loss. However, when Shary prepares to leave after declaring her work complete, the Simpsons instantly revert to their dysfunctional ways. Forced to stay when Grampa accidentally takes her umbrella, Shary watches helplessly as the family regresses. The Simpsons' incorrigible nature eventually breaks Shary's spirit, driving her to alcoholism and depression. Finally accepting that nothing can change the Simpsons, Shary bids farewell and floats away on her umbrella—only to be sucked into the engine of a passing airplane.
