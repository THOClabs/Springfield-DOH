## Synopsis

After attending a disastrous Spinal Tap concert, Bart becomes obsessed with becoming a rock star and convinces his parents to buy him a guitar. When Bart shows the guitar to bus driver Otto, Otto's impromptu jam session makes the kids late for school. In the ensuing reckless drive, Otto crashes the bus and is suspended when it's revealed he never had a driver's license.
