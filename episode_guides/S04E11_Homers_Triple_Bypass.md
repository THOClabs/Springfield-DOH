## Synopsis

Years of fatty foods and minimal exercise finally catch up with Homer when he suffers a massive heart attack after Mr. Burns fires him for sleeping on the job. Dr. Hibbert diagnoses severe arterial blockage requiring a $40,000 triple bypass surgery - money the Simpson family cannot afford. After being denied by insurance companies due to his poor health, Homer turns to Dr. Nick Riviera, an incompetent bargain surgeon who advertises "any operation for $129.95." In a tense operating room scene, Lisa guides Dr. Nick through the procedure using a medical book, ultimately saving Homer's life. The episode opens with a now-famous parody of the TV show COPS featuring Chief Wiggum.

## Scene-by-Scene Breakdown

### Opening Sequence

**Chalkboard Gag:** "Coffee is not for kids"
**Couch Gag:** The family appears shrunken on the couch.

**COPS Parody Cold Open:**
The episode opens with a parody of the TV show COPS. Chief Wiggum and officers pursue a cattle rustler through Springfield. The segment features classic COPS tropes - shaky handheld camera, ride-alongs, and incompetent police work. Wiggum mistakes Reverend Lovejoy's house for the rustler's location despite obvious clues they have the wrong address. He also fails to identify the fleeing driver beyond noting he is "hatless."

**Production Note:** This opening was added later because the episode ran short of its required 22-minute length.

**Animation Note:** Director David Silverman included a subtle touch - during Homer's out-of-body experience, his foot remained touching his body, signifying he wasn't truly dead.
