## Synopsis

After Homer gets stuck in a water slide at Mt. Splashmore water park due to his weight, he becomes humiliated and goes on a diet. Meanwhile, while cleaning the attic, the family discovers Marge's hidden collection of paintings from her high school days - all portraits of Ringo Starr, whom she adored as a teenager. Marge reveals she was an art student who gave up painting after a cruel teacher destroyed her confidence. Lisa encourages Marge to take art classes again, and she enrolls at Springfield Community College under Professor Lombardo. Marge flourishes and her talent is recognized. When Mr. Burns needs an official portrait painted for the new Burns Wing at the Springfield Art Museum, Marge is commissioned for the job. However, she struggles to find anything good to paint in the soulless billionaire. After Burns cruelly mocks Homer's weight loss efforts, Marge paints Burns in a brutally honest, unflattering nude portrait that shocks the unveiling audience but is hailed as a masterpiece for its raw honesty. In a subplot, Ringo Starr finally responds to a fan letter Marge sent him decades ago, encouraging her to never give up on her art.
