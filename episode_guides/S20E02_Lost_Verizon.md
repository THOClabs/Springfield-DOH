## Plot Summary

### Act One: The Golf Ball Business

Bart is walking through Springfield when he is accidentally hit by a golf ball near the Springfield Golf Course. He confronts the golfer, who turns out to be Dr. Hibbert. Hibbert pays Bart a dollar for retrieving the ball, which gives Bart the entrepreneurial idea to start a golf ball retrieval business to earn money for a cell phone.

Upon learning of a celebrity golf tournament, Bart prepares to retrieve balls and finally earn enough money. However, his business plan is ruined when Groundskeeper Willie takes his bucket of golf balls away, claiming Bart cheated him out of payment.

At the celebrity golf tournament, Denis Leary prepares to golf while being heckled by Krusty the Clown and Rainier Wolfcastle. When Leary's cell phone rings during his shot, he becomes so furious that he throws it away. The phone lands right beside Bart, who gleefully quits his golf ball retrieval job and takes Leary's phone for himself.

### Act Two: Cell Phone Shenanigans

While going to inform Milhouse of his new cell phone, Bart receives a call from producer Brian Grazer, who asks if Leary would like to star in the film adaptation of "Everybody Poops" as a constipated gorilla. Bart, realizing the phone belongs to Leary, pretends to be him and accepts the role.

Bart then embarks on a spree of mischief:
- Makes prank calls to bars all over the world
- Spends all of Leary's money on New York Yankees hats and uniforms
- Commits various other pranks using the phone

Marge overhears Bart and Milhouse's mischief and confiscates the phone. Leary calls to retrieve his cell phone, and Marge apologizes profusely for her son's behavior. Leary, still angry with Bart's tricks, pretends to forgive him but advises Marge to activate the GPS tracking system on the phone and return it to Bart, allowing her to track his every move.

### Act Three: GPS Tracking and Machu Picchu

Marge becomes increasingly overprotective, using the GPS to track Bart's location constantly. Bart eventually catches on to the GPS tracking and devises a plan to teach his mother a lesson. He attaches the GPS chip to a Scarlet Tanager bird, sending his family on a wild goose chase.

Lisa learns that the family is chasing a Scarlet Tanager whose migration pattern leads to Machu Picchu, Peru - a destination Lisa had expressed interest in visiting earlier in the episode. She "conveniently" neglects to tell her family this information so she can go on the trip she wants.

The family travels all the way to Machu Picchu following the bird's GPS signal. At Machu Picchu, Marge has a dream where an Inca god speaks to her:

"Like the mothers of ancient Machu Picchu protected their children? Our mothers were the most overprotective in the greater Machu Picchu metropolitan area. They forced their children to live in this walled mountain city. Walls that keep out danger keep out knowledge. Our young people never learned to survive on their own. So when they grew up they were no match for the conquistadors."

Marge learns her lesson: "So I can't always be there for Bart. He's got to learn to take care of himself."

Homer discovers: "The computer says Bart's standing on the computer. All I see is a stupid bird with a tracking chip on its leg. It doesn't add up." Marge responds: "I think it's time for us to go home."

### Tag

As the family prepares to leave, Lisa asks where Maggie is. The final scene reveals that Maggie was left behind in Machu Picchu, where she is being worshipped as a god by the local villagers.

### Critical Reviews

**IGN - 6.7/10**
Robert Canning of IGN said: "This wasn't a terrible episode, but it just was not funny enough for such a serpentine storyline. Throw in a wasted Denis Leary, and you really start to think that 'Lost Verizon' could have been so much more." He gave the episode a final rating of 6.7/10.

**The A.V. Club - B−**
Steve Heisler of The A.V. Club gave the episode a B−. He thought the plot was similar to the seventh season episode "Marge Be Not Proud" but felt this episode had the characters state their feelings to no one instead of showing their feelings as in the earlier episode. However, he liked the episode's one-off jokes.

**TV Verdict**
"It is a mostly solid episode, it feels like a missed opportunity for a show that garners more grumbles than acclaim these days."

**IMDb Rating**
The episode has an overall rating of **6.8/10** on IMDb.

**General Critical Consensus**
Fans and critics have stated that while the episode isn't the worst one, it's also not among the best. The general sentiment is that it was a "missed opportunity" with a convoluted plot that didn't maximize the comedic potential of guest star Denis Leary.

## Themes and Analysis

### Parental Overprotection
The episode explores themes of helicopter parenting and overprotective behavior through Marge's use of GPS tracking on Bart. The Machu Picchu metaphor cleverly illustrates how excessive protection can prevent children from developing necessary life skills and independence.

### Technology and Privacy
The episode was notably timely, airing just weeks after the first Android phone was released. It satirizes GPS tracking technology and the loss of privacy that comes with constant surveillance, even from well-meaning parents.

### Comparison to "Marge Be Not Proud"
Critics noted the similarity to Season 7's "Marge Be Not Proud," another episode about Marge and Bart's relationship when trust is broken. However, "Lost Verizon" takes a different approach by focusing on parental surveillance rather than trust restoration.

## Trivia

1. **Paul Newman Memorial:** The episode is dedicated to Paul Newman, who died nine days before the episode aired. Newman had guest starred in the Season 13 episode "The Blunder Years."

2. **Dr. Nick's Return:** This was the first episode to feature Dr. Nick Rivera after he was supposedly killed off in The Simpsons Movie.

3. **Production History:** The episode was originally planned for Season 19 but was held over to Season 20.

4. **Timing with Technology:** The episode aired just two weeks after the T-Mobile G1 (the first Android phone) was released on October 22, 2008, making the cell phone surveillance theme particularly timely.

5. **Denis Leary's Baseball Allegiance:** Leary's character wearing a Red Sox cap reflects his real-life devotion to the Boston Red Sox.

6. **Brian Grazer's Second Appearance:** Producer Brian Grazer previously appeared as himself in Season 10's "When You Dish Upon a Star."

7. **Everybody Poops Film:** The fictional film adaptation of "Everybody Poops" features Denis Leary as the "Constipated Gorilla." During the film's production, Leary (playing the gorilla) doesn't remember agreeing to be in it, so he gets a truckload of poop dumped on him.

8. **International Prank Calls:** Bart makes prank calls to bars around the world, including culturally-themed establishments that parody different countries and their cinema.

9. **Maggie's Deification:** The tag ending with Maggie being worshipped as a god in Machu Picchu is a callback to various stories of Western visitors being mistaken for deities by indigenous peoples.

10. **The Scarlet Tanager:** The bird species used in the plot is a real North American songbird that does migrate, though its actual migration pattern is to South America rather than specifically to Machu Picchu.

## Episode Significance

"Lost Verizon" represents The Simpsons' attempt to tackle contemporary issues of technology, privacy, and parenting in the digital age. While it received mixed reviews, the episode was timely in addressing GPS tracking and cell phone culture just as smartphones were beginning to become ubiquitous. The episode's central message about finding balance between protection and independence remains relevant to discussions about parenting and technology.

The episode also demonstrates the show's continued ability to attract high-profile guest stars (Denis Leary, Brian Grazer) and incorporate current events and technology into its satirical storytelling, even as the series entered its third decade on the air.
