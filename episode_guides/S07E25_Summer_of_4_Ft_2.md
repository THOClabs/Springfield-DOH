## Synopsis

On the last day of school, Lisa is devastated to discover how unpopular she truly is—no one will sign her yearbook while students line up to get Bart's autograph. When Ned Flanders offers the Simpsons his beach house in Little Pwagmattasquarmsettport for summer vacation, Lisa sees an opportunity to reinvent herself completely.

Determined to leave "nerdy Lisa" behind, she packs an empty suitcase, deliberately leaving behind all her books and academic accessories. At the beach, she convinces Marge to buy her a new "cool" wardrobe: a red cap, purple sunglasses, tie-dye shirt, ripped jeans, and brown sandals. With her new look, Lisa successfully befriends a group of local skateboarders—Erin, Dean, Rick, and Ben—by adopting a laid-back persona and hiding her intellectual nature.

Meanwhile, Bart grows jealous when his sister steals his thunder. When he tries to impress the cool kids with his skateboarding skills, they dismiss him for trying too hard. In a vindictive move, Bart exposes Lisa's true identity by showing her new friends her yearbook, filled with academic achievements and "nerd" activities.

Heartbroken, Lisa believes she's lost her only friends. However, in a touching finale, the beach kids surprise Lisa by decorating the family's car with seashells and a message of friendship. They reveal they don't care about her academic side—they like her for who she genuinely is. Lisa returns to Springfield with true friends who accept her completely.
