## Synopsis

When the Simpson family visits Storytown Village, a fairy tale-themed amusement park, Lisa becomes enchanted by the adorable lambs at the petting zoo. That evening, Marge serves lamb chops for dinner, and Lisa makes the connection between the cute animal she petted and the meat on her plate. Deeply troubled, Lisa declares herself a vegetarian. Her decision is met with ridicule from her family—Homer cannot comprehend that bacon, ham, and pork chops all come from the same "wonderful, magical animal"—and mockery at school, where she triggers the "Independent Thought Alarm" and is shown a meat industry propaganda film hosted by Troy McClure. When Homer throws an elaborate backyard barbecue to upstage Ned Flanders, Lisa creates gazpacho as an alternative, only to be mocked. In frustration, she steals the roast pig on a riding mower and launches it into the sky, ruining the party. After running away, Lisa finds an ally in Apu, who reveals he is a vegan and introduces her to Paul and Linda McCartney on the rooftop garden above the Kwik-E-Mart. With their encouragement, Lisa returns home to reconcile with Homer, who admits he was wrong not to support her choice. He offers her a "veggie back" ride home, and the episode closes with Paul McCartney's "Maybe I'm Amazed" playing over the credits.
