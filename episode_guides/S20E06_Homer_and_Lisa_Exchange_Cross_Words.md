## Full Plot

### Act One: The Lemonade Stand and Sweet Conclusions

The episode opens with Bart and Lisa running a lemonade stand outside their house. After Bart tosses a dollar in their jar to prime it, they're suddenly bombarded with customers. Homer, walking Santa's Little Helper, becomes thirsty and stops for lemonade. However, their operation is quickly shut down when they're discovered to be operating without a vending permit.

At the licensing bureau, Bart and Lisa find themselves in a long, motionless line. The holdup is caused by the clerk, who is absorbed in solving a crossword puzzle. Impatient, Lisa glances at the puzzle and completes it herself instantly. This moment awakens an addiction to crossword puzzles in Lisa.

Meanwhile, at Moe's Tavern, Edna Krabappel offers to buy a beer for anyone who will break up with Principal Skinner for her. Homer takes the job and successfully ends their relationship, discovering he has a natural talent for letting people down. Inspired, Homer decides to start a professional break-up service called "Sweet Conclusions," using his "patented TenderDump system" with the guarantee: "We'll be there in thirty minutes, or your next break-up is free!"

Homer's business thrives briefly. One memorable client is Grady (voiced by Scott Thompson, reprising his role from "Three Gays of the Condo"), who calls Homer to break up with his boyfriend because he's found a "better" man in Duffman. The episode features a musical montage of Homer's break-up business set to "Farewell to You, Baby" by Carl Martin.

However, when Marge questions the morality of the business, asking "What would happen if there was someone who could break us up every time I had my doubts about you?", Homer develops a conscience. He's visited by visions of the ghosts of children and shared furniture his breakup efforts have destroyed, leading him to close Sweet Conclusions.

### Act Two: Lisa's Crossword Career

Lisa's newfound passion for crossword puzzles develops into genuine expertise. The episode features a touching montage, including an "Obituary Montage" honoring words removed from the dictionary in the last year, set to "Fanfare for the Common Man." The words memorialized include:
- **Skedaddle** - a verb meaning to run off in a fright
- **Nixonian** - an adjective describing the Richard Nixon presidential era
- **Zounds** - an interjection like "damn" or "dang"
- **Mimeograph** - a copy machine that presses ink through a stencil
- **Hootenanny** - a gathering at which folksingers entertain with audience participation

When Lisa tells Marge she's become a "cruciverbalist," Marge misunderstands: "Oh, Lisa, another religion? You know, you'll just drop the whole thing at college when you get a Jewish boyfriend."

Lisa enters a citywide crossword tournament. At the licensing bureau, the scene where Lisa solves the crossword puzzle is a shot-for-shot adaptation of the Al Sanders scene from the 2006 documentary "Wordplay." Even Superintendent Chalmers shows up, revealing: "I'm a bit of a crossword head myself. They help me relax after a day of having to deal with... Skinner!"

### Act Three: The Betrayal and Reconciliation

Short on cash after closing Sweet Conclusions, Homer attends Lisa's tournament and discovers an underground crossword puzzle betting ring. He begins betting on Lisa's performances to make up for lost revenue. A musical montage set to "Word Up!" by Cameo shows Homer's gambling success.

Lisa advances to the championship finals against Gil Gunderson. When Lisa expresses doubt about the final round, Homer overhears and decides to hedge his bet by wagering against her, backing Gil instead.

During the championship match, Gil appears completely hopeless - spreading Q's in arbitrary squares and fumbling his glasses. Lisa grows confident she'll win, especially when Gil starts talking about how he's not that great and is only competing to honor his dead wife. When the match begins, Gil drops his glasses, and sympathetic Lisa leaves the stage to retrieve them for him. This is when she realizes she's been hustled - the glasses are fake, Gil never had a wife, and while she was helping him, he flew through the crossword puzzle, winning the competition.

Lisa discovers that Homer bet against her and made money from her loss. Devastated and furious, she refuses to acknowledge Homer as her father. In one of the episode's most emotional moments, she declares: "You stopped being my daddy when you bet against me! All I have now is a mom. That's why I'm taking her maiden name. So from now on, my name is Lisa Bouvier!"

When Lisa mentions that Jackie Kennedy's maiden name was also Bouvier, Marge thinks she means "Jackie O."

### Resolution

Feeling immense guilt, Homer seeks help from the crossword puzzle community. He commissions Merl Reagle and Will Shortz to create a special puzzle for The New York Times with his apology to Lisa hidden in the clues and solution. Homer writes a "So Proud of You" apology to Lisa in the crossword clues, echoing the way his mother gave him secret messages in earlier episodes.

The crossword puzzle appears in The New York Times (titled "Sounds Like Somebody I Know"), and Lisa solves it, discovering Homer's heartfelt message. The hidden apology reads: "Lisa, I'm sorry I bet against you. You're the best daughter a father could ask for. I'm so proud of you." The father-daughter relationship is restored, and they reconcile.

## Production Notes

### Inspiration and Development

The episode was inspired by Patrick Creadon's 2006 documentary "Wordplay," which chronicles the American Crossword Puzzle Tournament and features both Will Shortz and Merl Reagle. Executive producer James L. Brooks watched the documentary and thought Lisa participating in a crossword championship would make a great episode.

"We felt both Will and Merl were very compelling, off-the-beaten-track personalities [in Wordplay], who would fit into our universe very well," Brooks explained.

### Writing and Direction

Written by Tim Long and directed by Nancy Kruse, the episode carefully balanced Homer's comedic break-up business subplot with Lisa's more heartfelt crossword journey and their eventual emotional conflict.

### Crossword Puzzle Authenticity

Every crossword puzzle shown in the episode is a real, functional puzzle created in collaboration with guest stars Merl Reagle and Will Shortz. Reagle designed all the puzzles that appear throughout the episode, ensuring authenticity for crossword enthusiasts.

### Cross-Media Promotional Campaign

In a unique promotional effort, guest stars Reagle and Shortz collaborated with writer Tim Long to create a hidden Simpsons-related message that appeared in The New York Times Sunday crossword on November 16, 2008 - the same day the episode aired. The crossword was titled "Sounds Like Somebody I Know" and also appears as a plot point in the episode.

The Merl Reagle crossword puzzle with Homer's apology that appears in the episode was published as the nationally-syndicated New York Times crossword on November 23, 2008, one week after the episode aired.

Additionally, Harry Shearer recorded a special clip of Mr. Burns and Smithers announcing the prize for the winner of National Public Radio's Sunday Puzzle on November 16, 2008.

### Musical Selections

The episode features three musical montages:
1. **"Farewell to You, Baby" by Carl Martin** - accompanies Homer's break-up business montage
2. **"Word Up!" by Cameo** - plays during Homer's gambling montage
3. **"Fanfare for the Common Man"** - underscores the dictionary words obituary montage

## Cultural References

### Wordplay Documentary

The most significant reference is to the 2006 documentary "Wordplay" directed by Patrick Creadon. The scene at the licensing bureau where Lisa rapidly solves a crossword puzzle is a shot-for-shot adaptation of a scene featuring Al Sanders from the documentary. Al Sanders is a project manager at Hewlett-Packard in Fort Collins, Colorado, and a frequent finalist at the American Crossword Puzzle Tournament (ACPT).

### Crossword Culture

The episode authentically depicts the competitive crossword puzzle solving community, including tournament structures, time limits, and the intense focus required for speed solving.

### Jackie Kennedy Reference

When Lisa announces she's taking the Bouvier name, she mentions that Jackie Kennedy's maiden name was also Bouvier. Marge's confusion, thinking she means "Jackie O," plays on the former First Lady's famous nickname.

### Lisa the Greek Callback

Critics and fans noted the episode's structural similarity to Season 3's "Lisa the Greek," where Homer also uses Lisa's talents (football game predictions) for gambling purposes, endangering their relationship. The main difference is that "Lisa the Greek" made this the central plot, while this episode gives more time to Homer's break-up business.

### Mother Simpson Callback

Homer's method of communicating his apology through hidden messages in the crossword puzzle mirrors how his mother, Mona Simpson, sent him secret messages in earlier episodes.

## Trivia

### Episode Numbering
- This is the 426th episode of The Simpsons overall
- It's the 6th episode of Season 20
- Production code: KABF19

### Word Count Error
The word count of Homer's apology in the crossword puzzle is not actually 144 letters as stated. It's 149 letters with "one hundred and forty four" spelled out, or 134 using numerals (with no punctuation).

### Recycled Plot Structure
The episode is often considered a spiritual successor to "Lisa the Greek" (Season 3, Episode 14). Both episodes involve:
- Homer discovering and exploiting Lisa's special talent
- Semi-illegal gambling activities
- Homer earning lots of money from Lisa's abilities
- Their father-daughter relationship being endangered
- Ultimate reconciliation

The key difference is that "Homer and Lisa Exchange Cross Words" splits focus between Homer's break-up business and the crossword plot, while "Lisa the Greek" concentrates entirely on the gambling relationship.

### Guest Star Credentials
Will Shortz has been the crossword puzzle editor for The New York Times since 1993 and is the only person in the world to hold a college degree in enigmatology (the study of puzzles). Merl Reagle was one of America's best-known crossword constructors, with puzzles appearing in numerous publications including The San Francisco Chronicle and The Washington Post.

### Real Tournament Structure
The tournament depicted in the episode accurately reflects the format of real crossword competitions like the American Crossword Puzzle Tournament, including timed rounds and progressive difficulty.

## Goofs and Continuity

### Mathematical Error

### Character Behavior
Some critics noted that Homer's behavior in this episode is particularly insensitive and monstrous, even by his usual standards, making the reconciliation feel somewhat rushed.

### Critical Response

**TV Guide** (Daniel Aughey): Praised the episode for providing a "healthy balance" of humor, story, and heart, calling it "Exactly what makes a great Simpsons episode!"

**TV Verdict** (Erich Asperschlager): Found the puzzle-solving storyline "a lot of fun," both for its references to the "highly entertaining" documentary "Wordplay" and the jokes it inspired.

**The A.V. Club**: Positively noted this was "a Simpsons episode that reminded me a lot of the episodes I used to like from way-back-when." The reviewer appreciated how "scaling back the wackiness provided a nice balance to Homer's earlier antics," stating "The Simpsons needs a little groundedness every once in a while."

**Me Blog Write Good**: Offered a more critical take, describing the episode as "kind of like 'Lisa the Greek,' except it's terrible," criticizing how "insensitive and monstrous Homer is in this episode."
