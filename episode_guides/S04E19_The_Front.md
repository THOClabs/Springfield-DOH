## Synopsis

Frustrated with the declining quality of The Itchy & Scratchy Show, Bart and Lisa decide to write their own cartoon scripts. When producer Roger Meyers Jr. rejects their submission because they're children, they resubmit under their grandfather's name. The scheme works - Grampa is hired as a staff writer at $800 per week while Bart and Lisa secretly create all the scripts. Their episodes become critically acclaimed, but when Grampa is nominated for an Emmy, he finally sees the violent cartoon and delivers a scathing acceptance speech condemning cartoon violence. Meanwhile, Homer discovers at his high school reunion that he never actually graduated due to failing remedial science, prompting him to retake the class.
