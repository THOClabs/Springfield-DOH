## Synopsis

Troy McClure, a washed-up actor whose career was destroyed by a mysterious scandal at the Springfield Aquarium, gets an unexpected chance at redemption. When he's pulled over by Chief Wiggum for a traffic violation, he visits the DMV where he meets Selma Bouvier, who helps him cheat on his eye exam in exchange for a date.

When the tabloids photograph Troy with a woman, his agent MacArthur Parker realizes this could be the key to rehabilitating Troy's image and making people "forget all about that scandal at the aquarium." Parker advises Troy to continue dating Selma and eventually marry her to convince Hollywood he's a normal, straight man.

The publicity stunt works—Troy lands the lead role in a lavish musical production called "Stop the Planet of the Apes, I Want to Get Off!" where he plays the human Taylor. The show features the now-legendary song "Dr. Zaius" and becomes a hit, reviving Troy's career.

However, when Parker tells Troy that the really big roles now go to "family men," Troy pressures Selma to have children with him. Selma, who genuinely cares for Troy despite suspecting their relationship isn't real, is prepared to accept a loveless marriage—but draws the line at bringing a child into it. She confronts Troy, who admits the marriage is purely for his career. Selma leaves him, choosing her dignity over the Hollywood lifestyle, and Troy moves on to direct his own projects instead.
