## Synopsis

When tainted barley from Ogdenville contaminates Krusty Burger's new vegetarian sandwich, the neighboring town's economy collapses. Norwegian-descended Ogdenville residents flood into Springfield seeking work. Initially welcomed as laborers, tensions rise as hospitals overflow and local establishments are overrun. After Homer loses his job due to intoxication from Ogdenvillian aquavit, Mayor Quimby closes the borders and Springfield's citizens form a vigilante patrol. The community eventually builds a wall, ironically hiring Ogdenvillians to construct it, and discovers their shared humanity in the process.
