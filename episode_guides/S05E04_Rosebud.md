## Synopsis

On the eve of his birthday, Mr. Burns is plagued by dreams of his beloved childhood teddy bear, Bobo, which he abandoned decades ago when he left his family to live with a "twisted, loveless billionaire." The episode traces Bobo's incredible journey through history - from Charles Lindbergh's transatlantic flight, to Adolf Hitler's bunker during World War II, to being frozen in Arctic ice. When the bear ends up in the hands of baby Maggie Simpson, Burns will stop at nothing to get it back - offering Homer a million dollars, cutting off Springfield's beer and television, and even facing an angry mob. But it's Maggie's compassion, not Burns's schemes, that ultimately reunites the old man with his treasured bear.
