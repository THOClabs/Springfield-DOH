## Synopsis

The Simpson family is hired as winter caretakers for Mr. Burns' isolated mountain lodge. Mr. Burns cuts the TV cable and removes all beer to make Homer a more efficient worker, despite Smithers' warning that this is what caused previous caretakers to go insane and murder their families. Bart discovers he has telepathic powers ("the Shinning"), and Groundskeeper Willie tells him to use them if the family is in danger. Without TV and beer, Homer gradually descends into madness and attempts to murder his family with an axe.
