## Synopsis

Homer discovers that he actually won his high school class president election against Vance Connor, who has just been inducted to the Springfield Wall of Fame. Carl and Lenny reveal that the retired principal ordered them to bury the ballot box years ago. Homer excavates the box and confirms his victory. At Luigi's Restaurant, a magical saucier uses special tomato sauce to show Homer a vision of what his life would have been like if he'd won - wealthier and more successful, but without his children. The experience helps Homer realize his family's irreplaceable value.
