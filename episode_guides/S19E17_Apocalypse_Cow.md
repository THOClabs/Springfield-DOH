## Synopsis

After witnessing Martin Prince driving a combine harvester on their way to Shelbyville, Bart joins the 4-H Club to operate heavy machinery. At his first meeting, the 4-H volunteer introduces a competition where members will raise a calf over the summer to be judged at the county fair. Bart is stuck with the runt of the litter, a young bull he initially calls Lulubelle, but with encouragement from Mary Spuckler—one of Cletus's daughters—Bart renames him Lou and commits to raising him properly. Over the weeks, Bart bonds deeply with Lou, caring for him and training him until he becomes a magnificent bull that wins the blue ribbon at the fair. Lisa shatters Bart's joy by informing him that Lou's next stop is the slaughterhouse. Appalled and heartbroken, Bart rescues Lou with Lisa's help and takes him to Mary's farm for safekeeping. However, in yokel law, the gift of a cow equals a marriage proposal, and Cletus interprets Bart's gesture as asking for Mary's hand in marriage. Bart finds himself reluctantly engaged to an eleven-year-old. When Marge arrives to stop the wedding, Cletus sends Lou to the slaughterhouse in retaliation. In a twist, the "Lou" sent to slaughter is actually Homer in a cow disguise, while the real Lou is secretly flown to India to be treated as a sacred animal. The family rescues Homer from the slaughterhouse just in time. Homer vows to cut back on meat, and Bart reflects proudly that he can finally say, "I had a cow, man."

### ACT ONE

#### Scene 1: Watching Cartoons
**Location:** Simpson Living Room
**Characters:** Bart, Lisa, Marge

The episode opens with Bart and Lisa watching Saturday morning cartoons. They watch "Trans-Clown-O-Morphs," a Transformers parody featuring robots that transform into clowns. The show's character is quickly placed in a life-threatening situation and begs viewers to buy Trans-Clown-O-Morphs cereal to help him survive.

**Marge (annoyed):** The constant commercialization frustrates Marge, who decides to get the kids away from the TV.

Marge assigns Lisa to make banana bread and sends Bart with Homer to Shelbyville to have their beanbag chairs "rebeaned."

#### Scene 2: Road to Shelbyville
**Location:** Highway to Shelbyville
**Characters:** Homer, Bart, Martin Prince

On the drive, Homer tells Bart a story about Dean Martin. Bart questions the accuracy, noting it doesn't match Dean Martin's Wikipedia entry.

**Homer:** "Don't worry about Wikipedia, son. When we get back, we'll change it. We'll change a lot of things."

They pass Martin Prince driving a combine harvester.

**Bart (surprised):** "Why is Martin Prince driving a tractor?"

Bart gets stuck with the runt of the litter—a small, weak bull calf initially named Lulubelle.

#### Scene 4: Meeting Mary

**Characters:** Bart, Mary Spuckler

Bart tries to trade his runt calf but has no luck. He meets Mary Spuckler, one of Cletus's many daughters, who speaks in proper English unlike the rest of her family.

Encouraged by Mary's kindness, Bart renames the calf Lou and commits to raising him properly. Mary helps Bart learn proper animal care.

### ACT TWO

**Cletus:** "Well, I'll be! The boy's given Mary a cow! In yokel tradition, that's a marriage proposal!"

**Bart (shocked):** "What?! No, I was just—"

The Spuckler family immediately begins wedding preparations. Bart protests but is swept up in the yokel customs.

#### Scene 10: Wedding Preparations
**Location:** Spuckler Farm

The Spucklers prepare for the wedding. Music plays—a yokel version of Pachelbel's Canon. Spider-Pig makes a cameo appearance as a wedding present.

**Bart (panicking):** "I'm ten years old!"

Just as the yokel wedding is about to begin, Marge arrives.

**Cletus (angry):** "Fine! But if there's no wedding, there's no cow!"

Cletus immediately calls the slaughterhouse and has Lou picked up.

**Bart:** "No! Cletus, please!"

**Cletus:** "Too late, boy. Lou's heading to the killin' floor."

#### Scene 12: The Switch
**Location:** Various locations
**Characters:** Bart, Lisa, Homer, Lou

Lisa reveals the backup plan: the "Lou" being sent to the slaughterhouse is actually Homer in a cow costume, while the real Lou is being transported to the airport.

**Lisa:** "We knew Cletus might do this, so we made a switch."

At the airport, Bart says goodbye to Lou, who is being flown to India to be worshipped as a sacred cow.

#### Scene 13: Bart's Farewell to Lou
**Location:** Airport
**Characters:** Bart, Lou

Bart delivers an emotional farewell to Lou at the airport, using the same speech Rick gave to Ilsa at the end of "Casablanca." The music playing is "La Marseillaise" (the French national anthem).

**Bart:** "Here's lookin' at you, cud."

A plane employee explains Lou's destination.

**Airline Worker:** "In India, your cow will be treated like a god and receive the food and medical care that in America would go to human beings."

Lou boards the flight to India. Bart watches tearfully as his friend departs for a better life.

---

### ACT FIVE

#### Scene 14: The Slaughterhouse
**Location:** Slaughterhouse
**Characters:** Homer, Slaughterhouse Workers

Meanwhile, Homer—still in his cow disguise—is being processed at the slaughterhouse. He looks through the eye holes and misreads a sign.

**Homer (reading):** "You are now entering the laughter house... that sounds fun!"

A voice says, "You are now entering the killing floor."

**Homer:** "Hmm, that sounds like Tress MacNeille."

(Tress MacNeille is a voice actress on The Simpsons who voices many characters—a meta-joke acknowledging her ubiquity.)

Homer realizes his mistake and panics.

**Homer:** "D'oh! Wrong house!"

#### Scene 15: Rescue and Resolution
**Location:** Slaughterhouse/Simpson Home
**Characters:** Homer, Bart, Marge, Lisa

The family rushes to the slaughterhouse and rescues Homer just before he's processed, achieving what Homer describes as "a close shave."

**Marge:** "Really, Homer?"

**Homer:** "Well... cutting back a little."

#### Scene 16: Bart's Reflection
**Location:** Simpson Home/Car
**Characters:** Bart, family

As they drive home, Bart reflects on the experience.

**Bart (proudly):** "You know what? I can finally say... I had a cow, man."

This is a play on Bart's catchphrase "Don't have a cow, man" and represents his pride in raising and saving Lou.

The episode ends with the family together, Bart having learned about responsibility, compassion, and letting go.
