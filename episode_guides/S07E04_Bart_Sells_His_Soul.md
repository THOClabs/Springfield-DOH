## Synopsis

After pulling a prank at church by substituting the hymn with Iron Butterfly's "In-A-Gadda-Da-Vida," Bart is sentenced to clean the organ pipes alongside Milhouse (who ratted him out). During their punishment, Bart declares he doesn't believe souls exist and casually sells his soul to Milhouse for five dollars. What begins as a cynical joke turns into an existential crisis when Bart starts experiencing strange symptoms: automatic doors won't open for him, Santa's Little Helper growls at him, and he can no longer laugh at Itchy & Scratchy cartoons. Desperately trying to buy his soul back, Bart discovers Milhouse traded it to Comic Book Guy for Alf pogs, and Comic Book Guy sold it to an unknown buyer. Meanwhile, Moe transforms his bar into a family restaurant called "Uncle Moe's Family Feedbag," but his impatient, surly personality proves incompatible with family-friendly service.
