## Synopsis

When a new girl named Samantha Stanky moves to Springfield and joins Bart's class, Milhouse immediately falls head over heels in love with her. As Milhouse and Samantha spend all their time together, Bart becomes jealous and feels abandoned by his best friend. In a desperate attempt to reclaim Milhouse's attention, Bart tells Samantha's strict father about their relationship. Mr. Stanky responds by sending Samantha to Saint Sebastian's School for Wicked Girls, a convent school run by French-Canadian nuns. When Bart sees how heartbroken Milhouse is, he confesses what he did, leading to a physical fight. Eventually, both boys visit Samantha at her new school to apologize and say goodbye. Meanwhile, Marge orders a subliminal weight loss tape for Homer, but the company sends a vocabulary-building tape instead, causing Homer to speak with unexpectedly sophisticated language.
