## Synopsis

Lisa discovers she has an uncanny talent for predicting football game winners. Homer, seeing an opportunity, declares every Sunday during football season "Daddy-Daughter Day" and begins using Lisa's predictions to place bets at Moe's Tavern. Lisa is initially thrilled to spend quality time with her father, not realizing he's exploiting her gift for gambling. As Lisa's winning streak continues for eight weeks, Homer wins big and showers the family with expensive gifts. However, when Lisa asks if they can go hiking on the Sunday after the Super Bowl, Homer reveals that Daddy-Daughter Days will end until next football season. Heartbroken that Homer only values her for her predictions, Lisa refuses to help him anymore. For the Super Bowl, Lisa cryptically declares that if Washington wins, it means she loves Homer, and if Buffalo wins, she doesn't. Washington wins Super Bowl XXVI, and Homer cancels his plans with Barney to go hiking with Lisa, proving his love for her matters more than gambling.
