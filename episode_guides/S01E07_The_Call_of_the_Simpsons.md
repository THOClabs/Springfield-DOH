## Scene-by-Scene Breakdown

**Chalkboard Gag:** "I will not draw naked ladies in class"
**Couch Gag:** Standard family couch gag.

---

### ACT ONE

#### Scene 1: Simpson Home - Flanders' RV
**Location:** 742 Evergreen Terrace - Front Yard
**Characters:** Homer, Bart, Ned Flanders

Homer gently admonishes Bart for being jealous of something the Flanders have. Moments later, Homer sees that Ned has purchased a massive, luxurious RV.

Homer is immediately consumed with jealousy. He decides he must have an even better RV.

#### Scene 2: Bob's RV Round-Up
**Location:** Bob's RV Round-Up dealership
**Characters:** Homer, Marge, Bart, Lisa, Maggie, Cowboy Bob

Homer takes the family to an RV dealership run by Cowboy Bob, a fast-talking salesman.

Homer's eyes are drawn to the "Ultimate Behemoth" - an enormous, luxurious RV. However, when Cowboy Bob runs Homer's credit rating, the results are dismal.

**Cowboy Bob:** (checking computer) Homer's credit is so poor he barely qualifies for anything.

Despite his terrible credit, Cowboy Bob convinces Homer to purchase a much smaller, clearly dilapidated RV - essentially a lemon. Homer is conned into the purchase, believing he's getting a deal.

**Notable First:** Albert Brooks' first of many guest appearances on The Simpsons. He was credited as "A. Brooks" because he was uncertain about being associated with the then-controversial cartoon.

#### Scene 3: The Road Trip Begins
**Location:** Various roads, then remote backroads
**Characters:** Homer, Marge, Bart, Lisa, Maggie

The Simpsons set out on their camping excursion. Homer, trying to find adventure, veers off the main road onto increasingly remote backroads.

Marge suggests they turn back to the main road. Homer ignores her.

#### Scene 4: The Cliff
**Location:** Remote forest road / Cliff edge
**Characters:** Homer, Marge, Bart, Lisa, Maggie

The dilapidated RV struggles on the rough terrain. Eventually, the Simpsons find themselves at a precarious cliff edge.

The RV tips over and plunges off the cliff, crashing and destroying itself. The family barely escapes but is now stranded in the wilderness with no supplies, vehicle, or way to contact help.

---

### ACT TWO

#### Scene 5: Wilderness - Splitting Up
**Location:** Forest
**Characters:** Homer, Marge, Bart, Lisa, Maggie

The family assesses their situation. They have nothing - no food, no shelter, no way home.

Homer decides he and Bart will hike to find help while Marge and the girls stay at the crash site.

The family splits up.

#### Scene 6: Homer and Bart - The Waterfall
**Location:** Forest / River / Waterfall
**Characters:** Homer, Bart

Homer and Bart attempt to navigate through the wilderness. They encounter a river and try to cross it.

They fall into the raging water and are swept over a waterfall. The fall tears away all their clothing.

Homer and Bart emerge naked, cold, and embarrassed. They fashion primitive coverings from leaves and mud.

#### Scene 7: Marge and Lisa - Survival
**Location:** Forest camp near RV wreckage
**Characters:** Marge, Lisa, Maggie

In contrast to Homer and Bart's struggles, Marge and Lisa prove remarkably capable.

They successfully build a shelter, start a fire, and maintain a comfortable camp. Lisa and Marge work together efficiently, demonstrating practical survival skills.

#### Scene 8: Maggie and the Bears
**Location:** Forest / Bear cave
**Characters:** Maggie, bear family

Maggie becomes separated from the others. She wanders into the forest alone.

A family of bears discovers the baby. Rather than harming her, they adopt Maggie into their family.

The bears care for Maggie, keeping her warm and safe. They even raid another group of campers, stealing a bottle and baby toys to bring back to their new human cub.

**Notable:** This establishes Maggie's recurring ability to thrive in unusual circumstances.

---

### ACT THREE

#### Scene 9: Homer and Bart - Desperate and Hungry
**Location:** Forest
**Characters:** Homer, Bart

Homer and Bart spend a frigid, miserable night in the wilderness. They're starving and exhausted.

Homer spots a beehive full of honey. Despite Bart's protests, Homer attempts to steal the honey.

#### Scene 10: The Bee Attack and Mud Pit
**Location:** Forest / Mud pit
**Characters:** Homer, Bart

Homer smashes the beehive. The bees attack furiously, stinging his face and mouth, causing it to swell grotesquely.

In blind panic, Homer runs wildly through the forest. He falls into a mud pit, becoming completely covered in thick mud.

Homer emerges from the mud looking like a primitive, ape-like creature.

#### Scene 11: The Naturalist's Discovery
**Location:** Forest
**Characters:** Homer, Naturalist/Photographer

A nature photographer (naturalist) with a camera spots Homer lumbering through the forest - covered in mud, swollen from bee stings, wearing leaves, making grunting sounds.

The photographer is convinced he's witnessing Bigfoot. He captures footage and photographs of "the creature."

**Naturalist's description:** Notes the creature's "uncivilized look, its foul language, and most of all, its indescribable stench."

#### Scene 12: Media Frenzy
**Location:** Various - news broadcasts, forest
**Characters:** News reporters, hunters, general public

The naturalist's footage airs on television and causes a sensation. "Bigfoot" has been spotted!

A popular supermarket tabloid offers a $5,000 reward to anyone who brings in the creature alive.

Hunters and Bigfoot enthusiasts converge on the forest, searching for the creature.

The media circus inadvertently helps Marge and Lisa get rescued, as the forest is suddenly filled with people.

#### Scene 13: Homer's Capture
**Location:** Forest
**Characters:** Homer, Bart, hunters

Hunters spot Homer in the forest. Still looking like a mud-covered beast, Homer tries to communicate but only makes things worse.

The hunters shoot Homer with a tranquilizer gun. He collapses.

Homer is captured and taken for study.

#### Scene 14: The Tests and Study
**Location:** Research facility
**Characters:** Homer, scientists, Dr. Marvin Monroe

Scientists study and test Homer extensively, trying to determine if he is indeed Bigfoot or some unknown creature.

Homer, still groggy from tranquilizers and unable to clearly explain himself, undergoes various examinations.

#### Scene 15: Press Conference
**Location:** Press conference venue
**Characters:** Dr. Marvin Monroe, reporters

Dr. Marvin Monroe holds a press conference to announce the findings.

**Dr. Monroe:** Declares that the evidence is "inconclusive" as to whether or not Homer is Bigfoot.

Homer is released but not definitively cleared of being a monster.

#### Scene 16: Simpson Home - Aftermath
**Location:** 742 Evergreen Terrace - Bedroom
**Characters:** Homer, Marge

The family has returned home safely. Maggie was recovered from the bears. Everyone is reunited.

Homer and Marge watch the press conference just before bed. Homer is crestfallen - the world still isn't sure if he's human.

**Homer:** Worries about the teasing he's going to receive at work.

**Marge:** Consoles Homer, assuring him it doesn't matter what others think.
