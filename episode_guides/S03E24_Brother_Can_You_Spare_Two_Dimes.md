## Synopsis

The Springfield Nuclear Power Plant discovers that Homer's years of radiation exposure have left him sterile. To avoid a lawsuit, Mr. Burns bribes Homer with $2,000 and the "First Annual Montgomery Burns Award for Outstanding Achievement in the Field of Excellence." Meanwhile, Homer's half-brother Herb Powell - who was ruined after Homer's car design destroyed his company - reappears, homeless and destitute. Herb comes to the Simpson home hoping to borrow money to fund his latest invention. Despite Marge's hesitations and Herb's previous declaration that Homer was "no brother" of his, the family agrees to lend Herb Homer's $2,000. Herb uses the money to perfect his invention: a baby translator that interprets infant babbling into adult speech. Testing it on Maggie, the device works perfectly. The baby translator becomes a massive commercial success, and Herb becomes wealthy again. He forgives Homer, buys the family gifts, and the brothers are reconciled at last.
