## Synopsis

After Homer stops at Moe's Tavern for a beer and arrives too late to get Lisa's saxophone reed before the music store closes, Lisa is forced to perform at her school talent show unprepared and humiliates herself. Feeling guilty about failing his daughter, Homer decides to buy Lisa the one thing she's always wanted: a pony. Despite Marge's warnings about the financial burden, Homer takes out a loan from Mr. Burns and purchases a pony named Princess. When the monthly stable and upkeep costs exceed $500, Homer is forced to take a second job working the midnight-to-8 AM shift at the Kwik-E-Mart. The grueling schedule leaves Homer exhausted and barely functional, until Lisa realizes the toll it's taking on her father. In a touching finale, Lisa voluntarily gives up her beloved pony, telling Homer that there's a "big dumb animal" she loves even more than Princess.
