## Synopsis

Lisa persuades the Simpson family to try something new for dinner by visiting The Happy Sumo, a new Japanese sushi restaurant in Springfield. After sampling various dishes, Homer orders fugu (blowfish), a delicacy that can be lethal if not prepared correctly. When the master sushi chef is distracted having an affair with Edna Krabappel, his nervous apprentice Toshiro is forced to prepare the dangerous dish himself. Homer's impatient yelling causes Toshiro to rush, and the fugu is served improperly. After Dr. Hibbert informs Homer he likely has only 24 hours to live, Homer creates a bucket list and attempts to make the most of his final day on Earth. However, Homer survives the night, and while he vows to live life more fully, he quickly returns to his old habits.
