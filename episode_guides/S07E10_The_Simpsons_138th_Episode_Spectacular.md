## Synopsis

Troy McClure hosts a behind-the-scenes special celebrating The Simpsons' 138th episode, broadcast live from the Springfield Civic Auditorium. The episode combines clips from the original Tracey Ullman Show shorts, answers viewer mail about long-running mysteries (particularly Smithers' sexuality and Homer's declining intelligence), showcases never-before-seen deleted scenes from various episodes, and presents alternate endings to "Who Shot Mr. Burns?" The special is framed as a look back at the show's history with comedic commentary, including a fake origin story for creator Matt Groening and a closing nudity montage set to disco music. Notably, both the writer and director used pseudonyms because they didn't want credit for a clip show.

### ACT ONE

#### Scene 1: Troy McClure's Introduction
**Location:** Springfield Civic Auditorium
**Characters:** Troy McClure

Troy McClure takes the stage to rapturous applause (or so it seems).

**Troy McClure:** "Hello, I'm Troy McClure! You may remember me from such Fox network specials as 'Alien Nose Job' and 'Five Fabulous Weeks of The Chevy Chase Show.'"

He promises viewers an unforgettable look at their favorite family, including long-lost footage and never-before-seen material.

**Troy McClure:** "Tonight, we'll see long-lost footage, never-before-seen material, and old favorites you can't see in syndication!"

#### Scene 2: The Simpsons' Origins - Matt Groening
**Location:** Fake Documentary Footage
**Characters:** Troy McClure, "Matt Groening" (satirized)

Troy introduces the origins of The Simpsons, presenting a satirical fake biography of creator Matt Groening.

**Troy McClure:** "First, a bit of history. The Simpsons began as a crudely drawn cartoon short produced by Matt Groening."

The segment depicts Groening as a crazed, beer-swilling, right-wing Southerner who came up with The Simpsons while waiting for a meeting with producer James L. Brooks, desperate to pay off gambling debts.

**Fake Groening:** "I was in deep with the bookies. I needed something fast. So I named 'em after my own family and called it a day!"

This is entirely fictional and played for comedy.

#### Scene 3: Tracey Ullman Show Shorts - "Good Night"
**Location:** Simpson Home (Early Animation Style)
**Characters:** Homer, Marge, Bart, Lisa, Maggie

The first Tracey Ullman short, "Good Night," plays in its entirety. The animation is notably cruder with different character designs.

Homer and Marge try to put the children to bed. The kids resist sleep, and the short establishes the basic family dynamic with primitive animation.

**Homer:** "Bart, Lisa, Maggie—time for bed!"

The characters have longer, more angular designs and less refined voices.

#### Scene 4: Tracey Ullman Show Shorts - "Bathtime"
**Location:** Simpson Bathroom (Early Animation Style)
**Characters:** Homer, Bart

Another complete Ullman short plays. Homer gives baby Bart a bath, leading to comedic chaos.

**Homer:** "Alright, Bart, into the tub!"

Bart causes water to splash everywhere, and Homer ends up soaked.

#### Scene 5: Tracey Ullman Show Excerpts
**Location:** Various (Early Animation Style)
**Characters:** Simpson Family

Portions of three additional Ullman shorts play:

**"The Perfect Crime"** - Bart and Lisa scheme to steal cookies from the cookie jar.

**"Space Patrol"** - Bart and Lisa play astronauts while Homer yells at them.

**"World War III"** - The family reacts to what they believe is a nuclear attack, heading to a fallout shelter.

**Troy McClure (V.O.):** "As you can see, the early shorts were different. Simpler. More... terrifying."

### ACT TWO

#### Scene 6: Viewer Mail Segment Introduction
**Location:** Springfield Civic Auditorium
**Characters:** Troy McClure

Troy transitions to the viewer mail segment.

**Troy McClure:** "Now it's time to answer some of your most frequently asked questions about America's favorite family!"

He holds up mail cards as he reads questions.

#### Scene 7: Question #1 - Smithers' Sexuality
**Location:** Various (Clip Montage)
**Characters:** Troy McClure (V.O.), Smithers, Mr. Burns

Troy addresses the long-running question about Smithers' sexuality and his relationship with Mr. Burns.

**Troy McClure:** "Our first question comes from Gary in Portland. He asks, 'What's the real deal with Mr. Smithers? Is he gay?'"

A montage of clips plays showing Smithers' obvious affection for Burns:

**From "Rosebud":** Smithers fantasizes about Mr. Burns as a cake stripper, popping out and singing "Happy Birthday, Mr. Smithers!" in a Marilyn Monroe style.

**From "Dog of Death":** Burns asks Smithers what he would do if Burns died. Smithers responds with barely concealed emotional devastation.

**From "Homer the Smithers":** Smithers' dreams of Burns.

**Various Episodes:** Smithers gazing adoringly at Burns, protecting him, and expressing devotion.

After the montage, Troy delivers a non-answer.

**Troy McClure:** "As you can see, the real deal with Waylon Smithers is that he's Mr. Burns' assistant. He's in his early 40s, is unmarried, and currently resides in Springfield. Thanks for writing!"

#### Scene 8: Question #2 - Homer's Stupidity
**Location:** Various (Clip Montage)
**Characters:** Troy McClure (V.O.), Homer, Various

Troy addresses questions about Homer's declining intelligence over the years.

**Troy McClure:** "Our next question comes from Cindy in Tucson. She asks, 'Has Homer always been as stupid as he is now?'"

A montage demonstrates Homer becoming progressively dumber across seasons:

**From "Blood Feud":** Homer pretends to be Mr. Burns on the phone to retrieve an angry letter, a scheme that almost works.

**From "Flaming Moe's":** Homer's "Magical Man from Happyland" rant when confronting Moe about stealing his drink recipe.

**From "Marge vs. the Monorail":** Homer's car-driving inspired by The Flintstones, singing the theme while stalling the monorail.

**From "Deep Space Homer":** The famous floating potato chip scene, with Homer accidentally releasing ants in zero gravity, all set to "The Blue Danube."

**From "Treehouse of Horror V" ("The Shinning"):** Homer's descent into madness: "No TV and no beer make Homer something something..." "Go crazy?" "DON'T MIND IF I DO!"

**Troy McClure:** "As you can see, Homer's character has... evolved. Some say devolved. We say 'comedy.'"

A deleted scene from "Mother Simpson" (the episode earlier in Season 7).

### ACT FOUR

#### Scene 15: "Who Shot Mr. Burns?" Alternate Endings Introduction
**Location:** Springfield Civic Auditorium
**Characters:** Troy McClure

Troy introduces the final segment.

**Troy McClure:** "And now, the moment you've been waiting for! Never-before-seen alternate endings to 'Who Shot Mr. Burns?'"

He explains that multiple endings were produced to maintain secrecy about the shooter's identity.

**Troy McClure:** "To prevent the solution from leaking, the producers filmed multiple alternate endings with different shooters. Here they are!"

#### Scene 16: "Who Shot Mr. Burns?" - Alternate Shooter Montage
**Location:** Various (Alternate Scenes)
**Characters:** Mr. Burns, Various Suspects

A rapid montage shows different characters as the shooter:

**Moe:** Burns points at Moe in the hospital bed. Moe shrugs: "Yeah, I did it. So what?"

**Tito Puente:** Holding a smoking gun, Tito declares: "Revenge is sweet, Senor Burns!"

**Barney Gumble:** Barney burps and says: "I don't remember doing that, but okay!"

**Apu:** "Mr. Burns cut my hours! This is for the Kwik-E-Mart!"

**Santa's Little Helper:** The dog is somehow identified as the shooter, howling.

**Principal Skinner:** "I did it for Mother!"

**Patty and Selma:** The twins in tandem: "MacGyver would've wanted it this way."

#### Scene 17: "Who Shot Mr. Burns?" - Smithers Full Alternate Ending
**Location:** Hospital / Springfield
**Characters:** Mr. Burns, Smithers, Chief Wiggum, Jasper, Townspeople

A complete alternate ending plays where Smithers is revealed as the shooter.

Burns regains consciousness in the hospital.

**Wiggum:** "Mr. Burns! Who shot you?"

**Burns:** *(weakly)* "It was... Smithers."

Gasps from the crowd. Smithers is immediately confronted.

**Smithers:** "Sir, I... I did it because you broke my heart. You said you didn't need me anymore."

**Burns:** "Smithers, you fool! I only said that because I was delirious from sun-blocking!"

**Smithers:** "You mean... you do need me?"

**Burns:** "Of course I do, you simpering idiot!"

Smithers weeps with joy. Wiggum attempts to arrest him.

**Wiggum:** "Alright, Smithers, you're under arrest."

**Burns:** "Unhand my assistant! I refuse to press charges!"

**Wiggum:** "Works for me."

**Jasper:** "What about my wooden leg? Someone shot that too!"

**Smithers:** "That... that was me also. Sorry."

Troy notes this ending was rejected because it conflicted with the DNA evidence plot point (the shooter had Simpson family DNA).

#### Scene 18: Closing - Nudity Montage
**Location:** Springfield Civic Auditorium / Various Clips
**Characters:** Troy McClure (V.O.), Various Simpsons Characters

Troy introduces the final segment with a wink.

**Troy McClure:** "And finally, here's something for the late-night crowd. Simpsons characters as you've never seen them before... in their birthday suits!"

A montage set to K.C. and the Sunshine Band's "(Shake, Shake, Shake) Shake Your Booty" plays:

- Mr. Burns getting out of the shower with Smithers holding a towel
