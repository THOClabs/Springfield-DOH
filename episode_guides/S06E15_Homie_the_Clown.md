## Synopsis

Krusty the Clown's extravagant lifestyle and gambling addiction have left him nearly bankrupt and owing money to the mob. His accountant suggests opening a clown college to train regional Krusty impersonators as a revenue stream. Homer, after becoming obsessed with a clown college billboard, enrolls and graduates. He discovers that looking like Krusty (since Krusty's design is essentially Homer with clown makeup) gets him free stuff and special treatment all over Springfield. However, when Fat Tony's mob mistakes Homer for the real Krusty and demands payment of a gambling debt, Homer's impersonation becomes life-threatening. After the real Krusty is also captured, Don Vittorio DiMaggio demands they perform a loop-the-loop on a tiny bicycle - the one trick Homer never mastered. Together, Homer and Krusty successfully perform the stunt and their lives are spared. The gambling debt turns out to be only $48.
