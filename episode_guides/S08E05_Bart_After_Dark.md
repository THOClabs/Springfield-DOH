## Synopsis

When an oil tanker spills millions of gallons of oil on the coast, Lisa convinces Marge to volunteer for the wildlife cleanup effort. Homer is left in charge of Bart and Maggie, promising to keep everything under control—a promise that quickly falls apart.

While flying Milhouse's remote-control airplane, Bart crashes it into the yard of a mysterious Victorian mansion on the outskirts of Springfield. When he sneaks in to retrieve it, he accidentally destroys an expensive stone gargoyle. The homeowner, a dignified woman named Belle, appears and demands Homer pay for the damages.

Rather than face Marge's wrath, Homer cuts a deal: Bart will work at Belle's house to pay off the debt. What Homer doesn't realize—and what Bart soon discovers—is that the house, called "La Maison Derrière" (French for "The Back House"), is actually Springfield's burlesque establishment. Bart becomes an enthusiastic employee, working as a doorman and learning the business.

When Marge returns from the failed wildlife rescue (discovering celebrities only participate for publicity), she's furious to learn where Bart has been working. She organizes a town meeting and rallies an angry mob to destroy La Maison Derrière. However, just as the mob arrives, Homer leads the townspeople in a rousing musical number defending the establishment and its role in the community.

The music wins over the crowd—except Marge arrives late with a bulldozer and accidentally crashes into the building, causing significant damage. To settle the new debt, Marge agrees to perform her ventriloquist act at La Maison Derrière.

**Location:** Oil Spill Site
**Characters:** Marge, Lisa, Celebrities

Meanwhile, Marge and Lisa arrive at the cleanup site to find chaos. Celebrities pose for photos with oily animals but do nothing useful. The birds keep getting re-oiled.

Bart arrives at Belle's house expecting chores. He quickly discovers it's not a regular house.
