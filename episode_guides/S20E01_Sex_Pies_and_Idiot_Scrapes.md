## 2. Synopsis

"Sex, Pies and Idiot Scrapes" is the twentieth season premiere of The Simpsons. The episode features two parallel storylines: Homer becomes a bounty hunter after getting arrested during a St. Patrick's Day riot and meets bail bondsman Lucky Jim and bounty hunter Wolf. He teams up with an unlikely partner—Ned Flanders—to track down fugitives. Their successful partnership in capturing criminals like Snake and Fat Tony eventually sours when Homer's reckless methods frustrate the morally-conscious Ned. The partnership reaches its breaking point when Lucky Jim assigns Ned to bring in his final bounty: Homer Simpson himself.

Meanwhile, Marge unknowingly accepts a job at an erotic bakery run by Patrick Farrelly after impressing him with her cupcakes at the St. Patrick's Day festival. She continues working there despite discovering the bakery's adult-themed nature, leading to awkward moments when her creations appear around Springfield. The episode combines action-comedy with character-driven humor while exploring the dynamic between Homer's impulsiveness and Ned's moral compass.

### Critical Reviews

**Robert Canning (IGN)**: Called it a "fun, if standard, start to Season 20" and gave it a rating of 7.2/10. Canning appreciated the episode's entertainment value while noting it didn't break new ground.

**Joel Brown (MeeVee)**: Gave the episode a grade of B−, suggesting it was above average but not exceptional.

**Justin Gagnon (The Daily Collegian)**: Praised the episode as "worthwhile viewing for both big fans and occasional watchers" and stated it "proves that even after 20 seasons the show still can dish up some fresh laughs."

**Screen Rant**: Later designated this as the best episode of Season 20, indicating its quality held up well compared to the rest of the season.

**IMDb User Reviews**: Mixed reception from fans. Some praised the concept of Homer and Ned as bounty hunters, calling it "one of the coolest concepts" while noting "missed opportunities." Common criticisms included that "the writing just isn't in it" and "the once sharp and witty dialogue has been replaced with lazy parody of other shows and meandering stories." Overall consensus: "Not a great episode, but a good way to start the season."

### Controversy

The episode generated controversy in Northern Ireland and the United Kingdom over the St. Patrick's Day brawl depicting violence between Irish Catholics and Northern Irish Protestants. British Member of Parliament Gregory Campbell (MP for East Londonderry) expressed concern that people affected by actual IRA violence would not find Bart's line "Where are the IRA when you need them?" to be a light-hearted reference. As a result, this line is usually cut from UK broadcasts of the episode.
