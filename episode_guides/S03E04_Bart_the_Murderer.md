## Synopsis

After the worst day of his life - Homer steals his cereal prize, the dog eats his homework, he misses the bus, rips his pants, and forgets his permission slip for a chocolate factory field trip - Bart is forced to stay behind at school doing menial tasks for Principal Skinner. On his way home, he wipes out on his skateboard and falls down a stairwell into the "Legitimate Businessman's Social Club," where he meets Fat Tony, the Springfield mob boss. Bart impresses Fat Tony by picking a winning horse and mixing drinks, and is hired as their bartender. Unaware his employers are criminals, Bart accepts gifts and hides stolen cigarettes in his room. When Bart is late to work due to detention from Skinner, Fat Tony and his men decide to "meet and greet" the principal. Skinner mysteriously disappears, and Bart is arrested for murder. At trial, Fat Tony's gang pins all blame on Bart, naming him the Don. Just as Bart seems doomed, Skinner bursts into the courtroom - he'd been trapped under newspapers in his garage for a week.

### ACT TWO

#### Scene 4: The Skateboard Crash
**Location:** Springfield Streets / Legitimate Businessman's Social Club
**Characters:** Bart, Fat Tony, Legs, Louie

After his terrible day, Bart skateboards home.

He loses control and wipes out, crashing down a stairwell.

He tumbles into the basement entrance of the "Legitimate Businessman's Social Club."

**Goodfellas Reference:** This sequence mirrors Goodfellas, where a young boy falls into association with the mob.

#### Scene 5: Meeting Fat Tony
**Location:** Legitimate Businessman's Social Club
**Characters:** Bart, Fat Tony, Legs, Louie

Bart finds himself in a dimly lit bar filled with well-dressed men.

**Fat Tony:** The boss approaches Bart. Rather than being angry, he's amused by the boy.

**The Test:** Fat Tony asks Bart to pick a horse for the day's race. Bart randomly chooses one.

The horse wins.

Fat Tony is impressed. He offers Bart a job.

**Notable First:** This is Fat Tony's first appearance on The Simpsons. Joe Mantegna provides the voice, and the character is based on Paul Sorvino's Paul Cicero from Goodfellas.

#### Scene 6: Bart the Bartender
**Location:** Legitimate Businessman's Social Club
**Characters:** Bart, Fat Tony, Legs, Louie, Mobsters

Bart demonstrates he can mix drinks competently.

Fat Tony officially hires him as the club's bartender.

Bart is thrilled - he has a real job with real pay.

He's completely unaware that his employers are mobsters.

**Character Introduction:** Legs (tall) and Louie (short, violent) are introduced as Fat Tony's main henchmen. Louie is based on Joe Pesci's mobster characters, and Dan Castellaneta modeled his voice after Pesci.

#### Scene 7: Gifts and Cigarettes
**Location:** Simpson Home / Bart's Room
**Characters:** Bart, Homer, Marge, Fat Tony's Men

Bart begins receiving lavish gifts from Fat Tony.

Homer is initially suspicious but rationalizes it away.

**Homer:** Delivers a famous speech about job morality - "A job's a job. I mean, take me. If my plant pollutes the water and poisons the town..."

One day, Fat Tony asks Bart to hide some "merchandise" - boxes of cigarettes that have "fallen off a truck."

Bart stores the stolen cigarettes in his bedroom, still naive about what's really happening.

**Goodfellas Reference:** This mirrors Henry Hill's involvement in reselling stolen cigarettes as a juvenile.

---

### ACT THREE

#### Scene 8: Detention and the Threat
**Location:** Springfield Elementary / Legitimate Businessman's Social Club
**Characters:** Bart, Principal Skinner, Fat Tony, Legs, Louie

Bart attempts to bribe Principal Skinner to get out of trouble.

The bribe fails spectacularly. Skinner gives Bart detention.

This makes Bart late to his bartending job.

When Bart arrives late and explains why, he mentions Principal Skinner by name.

**Fat Tony:** Ominously announces that he and his men will "meet and greet" this Principal Skinner.

Bart doesn't fully understand the implications.

#### Scene 9: Skinner Disappears
**Location:** Springfield Elementary
**Characters:** Bart, Teachers, Students

The next day at school, Principal Skinner is nowhere to be found.

No one knows where he went. He simply vanished.

Bart begins to suspect that Fat Tony's "meeting" with Skinner was more sinister than he imagined.

Did Fat Tony have Skinner killed?

#### Scene 10: Bart is Arrested
**Location:** Simpson Home / Police Station
**Characters:** Bart, Police, Homer, Marge

Police arrive at the Simpson home.

They've connected Bart to Fat Tony's organization.

With Skinner missing and presumed dead, Bart is arrested and charged with murder.

The evidence: Bart worked for mobsters, had motive (revenge for detention), and Skinner vanished right after Fat Tony's men went to "meet" him.

---

### ACT FOUR

#### Scene 11: The Trial Begins
**Location:** Springfield Courthouse
**Characters:** Bart, Lionel Hutz, Fat Tony, Legs, Louie, Judge Snyder, Jury

Bart goes on trial for the murder of Principal Skinner.

**Defense Attorney:** Lionel Hutz (Phil Hartman) represents Bart - not exactly a confidence booster.

The prosecution presents their case: Bart was involved with organized crime and had reason to want Skinner dead.

#### Scene 12: The Mobsters Testify
**Location:** Springfield Courthouse
**Characters:** Fat Tony, Legs, Louie, Bart, Lionel Hutz

Fat Tony and his gang take the stand.

**The Betrayal:** Instead of protecting Bart, they turn on him completely.

They testify that Bart was actually the Don - the boss of their organization.

**Visual Reference:** A chart of photographs displays Bart as the head of the crime family, mimicking the "Michael Corleone Family" chart from The Godfather Part II's Senate hearing sequence.

The mobsters pin all responsibility for Skinner's disappearance on Bart.

#### Scene 13: All Hope Lost
**Location:** Springfield Courthouse
**Characters:** Bart, Lionel Hutz, Homer, Marge, Lisa

Things look terrible for Bart.

The evidence against him seems overwhelming.

Lionel Hutz's defense is ineffective.

It appears Bart will be convicted of murder.

#### Scene 14: Skinner Returns
**Location:** Springfield Courthouse
**Characters:** Principal Skinner, Bart, Judge, Everyone

Just as the verdict seems inevitable, the courtroom doors burst open.

**Principal Skinner:** Walks in, alive and well.

**The Explanation:** Skinner was never murdered. He had been trapped under a pile of newspapers in his garage for an entire week.

He was cleaning his garage when newspapers collapsed on him. He couldn't get out and no one heard his calls for help.

The charges against Bart are immediately dismissed.

#### Scene 15: Bart Quits
**Location:** Legitimate Businessman's Social Club
**Characters:** Bart, Fat Tony

With his name cleared, Bart confronts Fat Tony.

**Bart:** Officially quits the mob, rejecting Fat Tony and his organization.

Fat Tony accepts Bart's resignation, respecting the boy's choice.

#### Scene 16: The TV Movie
**Location:** Simpson Home - Television
**Characters:** Simpson Family, TV Movie Cast

The incident becomes the basis for a sensationalized TV movie: "Blood on the Blackboard: The Bart Simpson Story."

**The Cast:**
- Neil Patrick Harris as Bart Simpson
- Richard Chamberlain as Principal Skinner
- Joe Mantegna as Fat Tony (playing himself)

The family watches the inaccurate, over-dramatized version of events.
