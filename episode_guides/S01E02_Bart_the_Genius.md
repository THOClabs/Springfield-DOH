## Synopsis

After cheating on an intelligence test by switching papers with class genius Martin Prince, Bart is mistakenly labeled a genius with an IQ of 216 and transferred to a school for gifted children.

### ACT ONE

#### Scene 1: Simpson Home - Scrabble Night
**Location:** 742 Evergreen Terrace - Living Room
**Characters:** Homer, Marge, Bart, Lisa, Maggie

The Simpson family plays Scrabble together. The parents remind Bart he needs to improve his vocabulary to pass an upcoming intelligence test at school.

Bart struggles and eventually cheats by inventing a nonsense word: "KWYJIBO." When challenged, Bart defines it as:
> "A big, dumb, balding North American ape with no chin."

Homer realizes the insult is directed at him and angrily chases Bart through the house.

**Easter Egg:** While the family plays, Maggie spells "EMCSQU" with her toy blocks - a reference to Einstein's E=mc².

#### Scene 2: Springfield Elementary - Schoolyard Morning
**Location:** Springfield Elementary School - Exterior
**Characters:** Bart, Milhouse, Martin Prince, Principal Skinner

The next morning before class, Bart spray-paints graffiti on the school building that mocks Principal Skinner. Martin Prince, the class genius, notices and tattles to the principal.

Milhouse tries to warn Bart, but Skinner arrives and checks students' hands. Bart is caught "red-handed" with paint on his fingers. Skinner orders Bart to see him after school.

#### Scene 3: Springfield Elementary - Classroom / Test
**Location:** Springfield Elementary School - Mrs. Krabappel's Classroom
**Characters:** Bart, Martin Prince, Mrs. Krabappel, other students

During the intelligence aptitude test, Bart seeks revenge on Martin for snitching. When Mrs. Krabappel isn't looking, Bart switches his completed test with Martin's, writing Martin's name on his own paper of random answers.

---

### ACT TWO

#### Scene 4: Principal Skinner's Office
**Location:** Springfield Elementary School - Principal's Office
**Characters:** Homer, Marge, Bart, Principal Skinner, Dr. J. Loren Pryor

Principal Skinner meets with Homer and Marge to discuss Bart's behavior, preparing to suggest expulsion. Before he can, Dr. J. Loren Pryor, the school psychologist, arrives with surprising news.

Dr. Pryor announces that Bart has scored 216 on the IQ test, making him exceptionally gifted.

**Homer:** (reading paper upside down) "912!"
**Dr. Pryor:** "Uh, no. You have it upside down. It's 216."

Dr. Pryor suggests that Bart's behavioral problems stem from boredom - his regular schoolwork isn't challenging enough. He recommends transferring Bart to the "Enriched Learning Center for Gifted Children."

Skinner eagerly supports the transfer. Bart agrees when he learns the gifted school has minimal structure.

#### Scene 5: Enriched Learning Center - First Day
**Location:** Enriched Learning Center for Gifted Children
**Characters:** Homer, Bart, Ms. Mellon, gifted students

Homer drives Bart to his new school. Noticing all the boys wear ties, Homer gives Bart his own tie before pushing him through the classroom door.

Ms. Mellon welcomes Bart to the class. The gifted students engage in advanced discussions about free will and philosophy that go completely over Bart's head.

#### Scene 6: Gifted School - Lunchroom
**Location:** Enriched Learning Center - Cafeteria
**Characters:** Bart, gifted students

At lunch, Bart's classmates exploit his lack of understanding by proposing unfair trades. They convince him to swap vastly unequal measurements (1000 picolitres of milk for four gills), leaving Bart humiliated and with almost nothing to eat.

Bart realizes he doesn't belong at this school.

#### Scene 7: Springfield Elementary - The Outcast
**Location:** Springfield Elementary School - Playground
**Characters:** Bart, Milhouse, former classmates

Feeling miserable at the gifted school, Bart visits his old school to see his friends. However, his former classmates reject him, calling him a "poindexter" and refusing to hang out with him.

Bart is now an outcast in both worlds.

---

### ACT THREE

#### Scene 8: Springfield Opera House - Carmen
**Location:** Springfield Opera House
**Characters:** Homer, Marge, Bart, Lisa, Maggie, Boris Csupowski (conductor)

In an unexpected bonding moment, Homer takes the family to the opera to encourage Bart's intellectual development. They attend a performance of "Carmen" by Georges Bizet.

Rather than appreciating the high culture, Homer and Bart end up making fun of the opera together, mocking the Toreador Song. This becomes a genuine father-son bonding experience - the kind of normal activity Bart actually enjoys.

**Production Note:** The conductor is named Boris Csupowski, a reference to Simpsons animator Gábor Csupó.

#### Scene 9: Gifted School - Chemistry Lab Disaster
**Location:** Enriched Learning Center - Chemistry Lab
**Characters:** Bart, Ms. Mellon, gifted students

While performing a chemistry experiment, Bart accidentally causes an explosion. The lab is covered in green goo, and Bart's clothes are ruined.

This disaster is the final straw for Bart's time at the gifted school.

#### Scene 10: Dr. Pryor's Office
**Location:** Springfield Elementary - Dr. Pryor's Office
**Characters:** Bart (covered in green stains), Dr. Pryor

A green-stained Bart meets with Dr. Pryor to discuss his recent failures at the new school. Dr. Pryor theorizes that once again, Bart isn't being challenged enough - perhaps he needs an even more advanced environment.

Desperate to escape, Bart makes up an excuse. He tells Dr. Pryor he'd like to go "undercover" and study regular children, like Jane Goodall studied chimpanzees. Dr. Pryor agrees and asks Bart to write up a proposal.

**Cultural Reference:** Dr. Pryor compares Bart's proposed work to Jane Goodall's study of chimpanzees. Goodall was pleased to be mentioned and sent the show a letter.

#### Scene 11: Bart's Room - The Confession
**Location:** 742 Evergreen Terrace - Bart's Bedroom
**Characters:** Bart

Bart struggles to write a convincing proposal. Unable to maintain the lie, he changes course and writes a confession instead.

#### Scene 12: Dr. Pryor's Office - Truth Revealed
**Location:** Springfield Elementary - Dr. Pryor's Office
**Characters:** Bart, Dr. Pryor

Dr. Pryor returns and reads Bart's confession, learning the truth about the switched tests.

**Dr. Pryor:** "You know, you misspelled 'confession.'"

#### Scene 13: Simpson Home - Final Confession
**Location:** 742 Evergreen Terrace - Backyard/Bathroom
**Characters:** Homer, Bart

Homer gives Bart a bath in the backyard, still believing his son is a genius who just had a bad day with the experiment.

Bart confesses everything to Homer - that he switched tests with Martin Prince and isn't a genius at all. He admits it was stupid, but says he's glad because it brought them closer together.

**Bart:** "I love you, Dad."

Homer's initial touched reaction quickly turns to anger. An irate Homer chases the naked Bart through the house. Bart escapes to his bedroom and locks the door while Homer pounds on it, trying to coax him out.
