## Synopsis

Homer discovers that League Night bowling requires a $500 team registration fee, which he cannot afford. Seeking a sponsor, he approaches Mr. Burns while the tycoon is under the influence of ether from dental surgery. In his drugged state, Burns mistakes Homer for the Pillsbury Doughboy ("Pop 'n' Fresh") and happily writes him a check for $500. Homer uses the money to register his bowling team, the "Pin Pals," consisting of himself, Moe, Apu, and Otto. The team begins a winning streak that takes them toward the championship. However, when Burns recovers and discovers he funded the team, he demands to join as a player. Burns' terrible bowling skills cause the team to lose repeatedly, jeopardizing their championship hopes. In the final match against "The Holy Rollers," Burns unexpectedly makes a crucial winning shot. But rather than celebrate with his teammates, Burns keeps the championship trophy for himself at his mansion, leaving Homer and the others empty-handed.

Meanwhile, Bart wears a "Down With Homework" iron-on decal from MAD Magazine to school, causing a student riot. In response, Principal Skinner implements mandatory school uniforms across Springfield Elementary. The gray, conformist uniforms suppress the students' individuality and rebellious nature, creating an eerily compliant student body. However, when an unexpected rainstorm causes the uniforms' dye to run and turn them tie-dye, the students regain their colorful personalities and rebellious spirits.

Homer and his friends arrive at the bowling alley excited to join League Night bowling. Their enthusiasm dims when they learn about the $500 registration fee.

**Manager:** "League night requires a five-hundred-dollar registration fee."

**Homer:** (dismayed) "Five hundred dollars?!"

The group doesn't have the money. Homer is crestfallen at the prospect of missing out on competitive bowling.

#### Scene 3: Simpson Home - Marge's Suggestion
**Location:** 742 Evergreen Terrace - Kitchen
**Characters:** Homer, Marge

Homer complains to Marge about the registration fee. She offers practical advice.

**Marge:** "Why don't you ask a wealthy person to sponsor your team?"

Homer immediately thinks of Mr. Burns.

#### Scene 4: Springfield Nuclear Plant - Burns on Ether
**Location:** Burns' Office
**Characters:** Homer, Mr. Burns, Smithers

Homer arrives at Burns' office to find the elderly tycoon recovering from dental surgery, still heavily under the influence of ether. Burns is giggling and confused.

**Burns:** (loopy) "Ooh, it's the Pillsbury Doughboy! Hee hee!"

In his drugged state, Burns mistakes Homer for "Pop 'n' Fresh" (the Pillsbury mascot). Homer plays along, and Burns happily writes him a check for $500.

**Homer:** (poking his own belly) "Hoo hoo!"

Homer escapes with the check before Burns can come to his senses.

**Location:** Springfield Elementary School

At school, Bart proudly wears a t-shirt with an iron-on decal from MAD Magazine reading "Down With Homework."

### ACT TWO

#### Scene 7: The Pin Pals Begin Winning
**Location:** Barney's Bowl-A-Rama
**Characters:** Homer, Moe, Apu, Otto, Various Opponents

With their registration paid, the "Pin Pals" begin competing in League Night. The team proves surprisingly effective, winning match after match.

The team develops a signature chant for Otto:

**Team:** "You can do it, Otto! You can do it, Otto!"

The victories bring the team closer together, and they climb the rankings toward the championship.

#### Scene 8: School Uniforms Take Effect
**Location:** Springfield Elementary
**Characters:** Bart, Lisa, Milhouse, Nelson, Other Students, Teachers

The uniform policy dramatically changes student behavior. With everyone dressed identically in gray, students become eerily compliant and subdued.

**Lisa:** (observing) "It's like the uniforms have drained their personality..."

Even notorious bullies like Nelson become passive. The teachers are pleasantly surprised but somewhat disturbed by the transformation.

Bart, usually the ringleader of mischief, walks quietly through the halls like a zombie.

#### Scene 9: Burns Recovers - Demands to Join
**Location:** Burns' Office
**Characters:** Mr. Burns, Smithers, Homer

Mr. Burns, now fully recovered from the ether, reviews his finances and discovers the $500 check to Homer.

**Burns:** "What's this? I paid $500 to that oaf Simpson?"

**Smithers:** "It appears you sponsored his bowling team, sir."

Burns demands to meet with Homer. Rather than wanting his money back, Burns insists on joining the Pin Pals as a player.

**Burns:** "I shall join this bowling team and lead them to victory!"

Homer reluctantly agrees, unable to refuse his boss.

#### Scene 10: Burns Ruins the Team
**Location:** Barney's Bowl-A-Rama
**Characters:** Homer, Moe, Apu, Otto, Mr. Burns

Burns proves to be a terrible bowler. His frail arms can barely lift the ball, and his throws consistently end up in the gutter.

**Burns:** (attempting to bowl) "I'll show you athletic prowess..."

The ball dribbles slowly down the lane and falls into the gutter.

The Pin Pals' winning streak comes to an abrupt end. They begin losing game after game with Burns on the team.

**Moe:** "We were this close to the championship!"

**Homer:** (defeated) "Now we're the laughingstock of the league."

---

### ACT THREE

#### Scene 11: The Championship Match Setup
**Location:** Barney's Bowl-A-Rama
**Characters:** Pin Pals, The Holy Rollers (Ned Flanders, Reverend Lovejoy, and team), Spectators

Despite their recent losses, the Pin Pals still qualify for the championship match against "The Holy Rollers" - a team of devout Christians including Ned Flanders and Reverend Lovejoy.

**Ned:** "Well, Homer, may the best team win - and by best, I mean most pleasing to the Lord!"

The match is close, with both teams trading frames. The championship comes down to the final throw.

#### Scene 12: Rainstorm - Uniforms Transform
**Location:** Springfield Elementary - Outdoors
**Characters:** Students, Principal Skinner

An unexpected rainstorm catches the students outside during recess. The rain causes the cheap uniform dye to run, transforming the gray uniforms into colorful tie-dye patterns.

As the colors emerge, so do the students' personalities. They begin acting like their normal selves again.

**Bart:** (looking at his tie-dye uniform) "Whoa! Cool!"

**Nelson:** (punching a kid) "Ha-ha!"

The behavioral experiment inadvertently ends as the colorful uniforms restore the students' individuality.

**Skinner:** (dismayed) "The uniforms! They're... they're tie-dyed!"

#### Scene 13: Burns' Winning Shot
**Location:** Barney's Bowl-A-Rama
**Characters:** Pin Pals, The Holy Rollers, Spectators

With the championship on the line, Burns steps up for the final throw. Everyone expects disaster.

**Homer:** (to Moe) "We're doomed."

Burns slowly approaches the lane. In an unexpected turn, his weak throw somehow curves perfectly into the pins, knocking them all down for a strike.

**Crowd:** (gasping) "STRIKE!"

The Pin Pals win the championship! Homer, Moe, Apu, and Otto celebrate wildly.

**Homer:** "We did it! We're champions!"

#### Scene 14: Burns Takes the Trophy
**Location:** Burns' Mansion
**Characters:** Mr. Burns, Smithers

Rather than sharing the victory with his teammates, Burns takes the championship trophy home to his mansion.

**Burns:** (admiring trophy) "Excellent. This shall look perfect in my trophy room."

The trophy joins Burns' vast collection of accolades and achievements, all won through similar underhanded means.

#### Scene 15: Homer's Attempted Heist
**Location:** Burns' Mansion Grounds
**Characters:** Homer, Mr. Burns' Dogs

Homer, feeling cheated out of his team's trophy, attempts to sneak onto Burns' property to steal it back.

**Homer:** (sneaking) "That trophy belongs to the Pin Pals, not Burns..."

Before he can reach the mansion, Burns' attack dogs are released. Homer is chased off the property, bitten and defeated.

**Homer:** (running away) "Ahhh! Bad dogs! Bad dogs!"

#### Scene 16: Resolution
**Location:** Simpson Home
**Characters:** Homer, Marge

Homer returns home, dejected and dog-bitten. Marge comforts him.

**Marge:** "Oh, Homie. At least you have the memories."

**Homer:** (sighing) "I guess so. But those dogs really hurt."

Despite losing the trophy, Homer finds some solace in the experience of competing with his friends.
