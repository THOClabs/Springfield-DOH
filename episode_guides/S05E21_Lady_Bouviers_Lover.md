## Synopsis

At Maggie's first birthday party, Grampa Simpson bonds with Marge's mother, Jacqueline Bouvier, and they begin dating. Marge is delighted by the romance, but Homer is disturbed by the prospect of becoming his wife's stepbrother. The relationship flourishes until a night out at the Springfield Community Center, where Jacqueline catches the eye of Mr. Burns, who sweeps her off her feet with his wealth and power. Grampa is heartbroken when Jacqueline accepts Burns' marriage proposal. In a climactic scene parodying "The Graduate," Grampa crashes the wedding by banging on the church window and shouting "Mrs. Bouvier!" Jacqueline ultimately chooses neither man, leaving on a bus with Grampa while Burns is left at the altar. Meanwhile, Bart uses Homer's credit card to buy an expensive Itchy & Scratchy animation cel that turns out to be a disappointment.
