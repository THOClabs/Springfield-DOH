## Synopsis

After a bear wanders into Springfield, Mayor Quimby creates an expensive "Bear Patrol" funded by a $5 tax increase. When citizens protest the tax, Quimby deflects blame onto undocumented immigrants and places Proposition 24 on the ballot, which would deport all illegal immigrants. When Apu discovers his student visa expired years ago, he faces deportation if the measure passes. After briefly obtaining fraudulent citizenship papers from Fat Tony, Apu's conscience leads him to abandon this plan. With help from Lisa (and despite Homer's comically inaccurate history lessons), Apu studies for the U.S. citizenship test. He passes and becomes a legal citizen just before the vote. The episode ends with Groundskeeper Willie being deported, suggesting he failed the exam.

## Production Notes

### Episode Development
- Written by David S. Cohen (later David X. Cohen, co-creator of Futurama)
- Inspired by California's Proposition 187 anti-immigrant initiative
- Proposition number "24" chosen because it was Cohen's Little League number
- Bear storyline inspired by real news reports of bears in Southern California neighborhoods
- The Civil War test scene based on a real experience of Cohen's friend during her citizenship test

### Real-World Parallels
- Bill Oakley noted that California news reports often create "anti-bear hysteria"
- The episode satirizes how politicians redirect public anger toward scapegoats
- Moe's hypocrisy (anti-immigrant but taking the test himself) reflects real-world contradictions
