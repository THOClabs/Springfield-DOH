## Synopsis

As punishment for a prank on Principal Skinner, Bart is forced to help him with early morning astronomy observations. During one session, Bart accidentally discovers a comet—which is promptly named after him. However, "Bart's Comet" is on a collision course with Springfield. As the town panics, they build a rocket to destroy the comet, but it fails spectacularly. The citizens retreat to the Flanders family bomb shelter, but when there's not enough room for everyone, they almost throw Ned out. In the end, the comet harmlessly burns up in Springfield's thick layer of pollution, saving the town. The episode is celebrated for its satirical look at mob mentality and community crisis response.

The entire town crowds into Ned's modest shelter. It's far too small.

**Moe:** "Someone's gotta go!"

The mob turns on each other, debating who should leave.

#### Scene 11: Targeting Flanders
**Location:** Bomb Shelter
**Characters:** All

In twisted mob logic, the townspeople decide Ned—who built and shared his shelter—should be the one to leave.

**Homer:** "Flanders! You should go! It's your shelter, you're responsible!"

**Moe:** "Yeah! Throw out Flanders!"

#### Scene 13: Homer's Conscience
**Location:** Bomb Shelter
**Characters:** Homer, Citizens

Homer feels guilty. He looks at the frightened townspeople—all alive because of Ned.

**Lisa:** "Dad's right. We're monsters."

One by one, citizens leave the shelter to stand with Ned.

Everyone exits to face the comet with Ned.

### ACT FOUR

#### Scene 14: Awaiting the Comet
**Location:** Outside / Street
**Characters:** All Citizens, Ned

The entire town stands together, watching the comet approach.

**Ned:** "Well, if this is the end, at least we're together."

**Homer:** "I'm sorry, Flanders. You're actually a great neighbor."

**Ned:** "That means a lot, Homer."

They hold hands (figuratively) as the comet enters the atmosphere.

#### Scene 15: The Comet Burns Up
**Location:** Springfield Sky
**Characters:** All

The comet enters Springfield's atmosphere... and dramatically shrinks. The thick layer of pollution from Springfield's factories burns it away.

**Lisa:** "It's burning up! The comet is burning up in the atmosphere!"

**Homer:** "Our smog! Our beautiful smog saved us!"

The comet—now the size of a chihuahua's head—lands harmlessly, only destroying Ned's empty shelter.

**Ned:** "My shelter! Oh well. The Lord giveth and the Lord taketh away."

#### Scene 16: Resolution
**Location:** Springfield Streets
**Characters:** All

Springfield celebrates. The town is saved.

**Mayor Quimby:** "Let this be a lesson: pollution saves lives!"

**Lisa:** "That's... not really the lesson."

**Homer:** "It is today!"

The townspeople cheer. Ned accepts the destruction of his shelter graciously.

**Ned:** "I'm just glad everyone's okay."

**Bart:** "I guess my comet wasn't so great after all."

**Homer:** "Don't worry, boy. Next disaster, we'll handle it exactly the same way."
