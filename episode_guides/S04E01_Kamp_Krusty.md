## Synopsis

Bart and Lisa eagerly anticipate spending summer at Kamp Krusty, "The Krustiest Place On Earth." Homer agrees to let Bart attend only if he earns a C average, but when Bart fails, Homer sends him anyway just to enjoy a kid-free summer. The camp turns out to be a nightmare: run by the exploitative Mr. Black, with Springfield bullies as counselors, serving inedible food and forcing children into sweatshop labor. When the promised visit from Krusty turns out to be Barney Gumbel in a bad costume, Bart leads a full-scale revolt. The real Krusty finally arrives, apologizes, and takes the kids to Tijuana to make amends.

### ACT ONE

#### Scene 1: Bart's Dream
**Location:** Springfield Elementary (dream sequence)
**Characters:** Bart, students, faculty

Bart dreams of the last day of school, where he leads a destructive celebration. Students tear apart the school in joyous chaos.

He wakes up - it's actually the last day of school, but not as dramatic as his dream.

#### Scene 2: Last Day of School
**Location:** Springfield Elementary
**Characters:** Bart, Lisa, Mrs. Krabappel, students

The school year ends. Lisa receives excellent grades (with only a B in conduct). 

Bart's grades are terrible - D-minuses across the board. He pleads with Mrs. Krabappel to change them, but she refuses.

#### Scene 3: Report Card Deception
**Location:** Simpson Home
**Characters:** Bart, Homer, Marge

Bart attempts to alter his report card with a marker, changing D-minuses to A-plusses. The forgery is obvious and crude.

Homer sees through the deception immediately. However, to everyone's surprise, he lets Bart go to Kamp Krusty anyway.

**Homer's reasoning:** He simply doesn't want to deal with Bart all summer.

#### Scene 4: Departure for Camp
**Location:** Simpson Home / Bus
**Characters:** Bart, Lisa, Homer, Marge, other campers

Bart and Lisa excitedly board the bus for Kamp Krusty, "The Krustiest Place On Earth."

### ACT TWO

#### Scene 5: Arrival at Kamp Krusty
**Location:** Kamp Krusty
**Characters:** Bart, Lisa, Mr. Black, campers, bullies

The campers arrive at Kamp Krusty with high expectations. The camp looks decrepit even from the entrance.

Mr. Black, the camp director, greets them. He announces that Krusty won't be around for several weeks.

Instead, he introduces the camp counselors: Jimbo, Dolph, and Kearney - Springfield's notorious bullies.

The kids are immediately worried.

#### Scene 6: Camp Conditions
**Location:** Kamp Krusty - Various areas
**Characters:** Bart, Lisa, campers, counselors

The camp is a nightmare:
- **Cabins:** Decrepit, falling apart, infested
- **Food:** "Krusty Brand Imitation Gruel" - barely edible
- **Activities:** Forced labor making counterfeit Gucci wallets
- **"Nature marches":** Brutal forced hikes
- **Counselors:** The bullies terrorize and abuse the campers

Lisa writes desperate letters home describing the sweatshop conditions.

#### Scene 7: Parents Ignore the Warnings
**Location:** Simpson Home
**Characters:** Homer, Marge

Homer and Marge receive Lisa's letters but dismiss her complaints as typical kid exaggeration.

They're having the time of their lives without the children. Homer has grown new hair, lost weight, and looks years younger.

Their romance is rekindled. They have no interest in investigating the camp.

#### Scene 8: Conditions Worsen
**Location:** Kamp Krusty
**Characters:** Bart, Lisa, campers, Mr. Black

A storm damages the already terrible facilities. The children are cold, hungry, and miserable.

Mr. Black continues to exploit the kids while living comfortably himself.

Bart tries to keep spirits up, promising that Krusty will come and make everything right.

---

### ACT THREE

#### Scene 9: "Krusty" Arrives
**Location:** Kamp Krusty - Main area
**Characters:** Bart, Lisa, campers, Mr. Black, "Krusty" (Barney)

Mr. Black finally announces that Krusty has arrived. The children gather excitedly.

But the "Krusty" who appears is obviously Barney Gumbel in a terrible, ill-fitting costume. The disguise fools no one.

Bart immediately recognizes the fraud.

**Bart:** "That's not Krusty the Clown!"

#### Scene 10: The Rebellion
**Location:** Kamp Krusty
**Characters:** Bart, Lisa, campers, Mr. Black, bullies

Pushed past his breaking point, Bart snaps. He gives an impassioned speech rallying the other campers.

The children revolt against Mr. Black and the bully counselors. They take over the camp in a "Lord of the Flies" style uprising.

Mr. Black and his cronies are forced to flee.

The rebellion makes national news.

#### Scene 11: Homer's Reaction
**Location:** Simpson Home
**Characters:** Homer, Marge, Kent Brockman (on TV)

Homer and Marge see the news coverage of the camp rebellion. Homer's reaction is complex - he's mostly just annoyed his peaceful summer is over.

The stress causes Homer to immediately regain his weight and lose his hair again.

#### Scene 12: Krusty Arrives
**Location:** Kamp Krusty
**Characters:** Krusty, Bart, Lisa, campers

The REAL Krusty the Clown finally shows up. He's shocked to see what Mr. Black has done in his name.

Krusty apologizes to the children. He was unaware of the conditions - he just licensed his name and never checked on the camp.

To make amends, Krusty announces he's taking all the kids on a trip.

#### Scene 13: Tijuana
**Location:** Tijuana, Mexico
**Characters:** Krusty, Bart, Lisa, campers

Krusty takes all the Kamp Krusty kids to Tijuana, Mexico for the rest of the summer.

The children finally have a great time - though Tijuana is perhaps not the most appropriate destination.

**Bart:** "Krusty, this is the best summer ever!"
