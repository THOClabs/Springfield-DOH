## Synopsis

Homer accidentally prevents a nuclear meltdown at the Springfield Nuclear Power Plant by randomly pressing a button, becoming an unlikely hero celebrated throughout Springfield.

However, this time his method is exposed, leading to the phrase "pulling a Homer" entering the cultural lexicon as slang for succeeding through sheer incompetence.
