Homer discovers he has no choice but to wear a pink shirt to work.

**Location:** Springfield Nuclear Power Plant
**Characters:** Homer, Mr. Burns, Smithers, co-workers

Homer arrives at the nuclear plant wearing his pink shirt. His co-workers mock him, but the real trouble comes when Mr. Burns sees him.

#### Scene 3: The Psychological Evaluation
**Location:** Springfield Nuclear Power Plant - HR Office
**Characters:** Homer, Bart (indirectly)

Homer is given a psychological evaluation questionnaire to complete at home. Too lazy to fill it out himself, Homer has Bart complete the form for him.

**Location:** Mental Institution - Homer's Room
**Characters:** Homer, Leon Kompowsky

Homer is assigned a roommate: a large, heavyset, bald white man who introduces himself as Michael Jackson.

Homer, unfamiliar with the famous pop star, doesn't understand why this is unusual. "Michael" demonstrates his signature moonwalk dance for Homer.

**Homer:** "How do you do that thing with your feet?"

Homer attempts the moonwalk but slides forward instead of backward.

Leon cuddles a teddy bear and mumbles to it, "Bubbles, it's going to be a long night" - a reference to Jackson's famous pet chimpanzee.

**Location:** Simpson Home

#### Scene 8: Marge Visits Homer
**Location:** Mental Institution
**Characters:** Marge, Homer, doctors

Marge visits Homer at the mental hospital. She speaks with the doctors, who reveal they believe Homer's son "Bart" is a figment of his imagination.

The next day, a massive crowd has gathered outside the Simpson home, eagerly awaiting Michael Jackson's appearance.

The crowd disperses angrily, and Bart is blamed for the deception.

#### Scene 12: Lisa's Forgotten Birthday
**Location:** Simpson Home
**Characters:** Lisa, Bart, family

In all the excitement about "Michael Jackson," Bart has completely forgotten Lisa's birthday.

Lisa is devastated. She writes Bart a letter expressing her hurt and anger, declaring she will hate him forever.

This is one of Lisa's lowest moments - feeling invisible to her own brother on her special day.

#### Scene 13: Leon Helps Bart
**Location:** Simpson Home - Bart's Room
**Characters:** Bart, Leon

Leon finds Bart feeling terrible about forgetting Lisa's birthday. He offers to help Bart make things right.

Together, they work through the night to write a special birthday song for Lisa.

#### Scene 14: "Happy Birthday Lisa"
**Location:** Simpson Home - Lisa's Room
**Characters:** Bart, Leon, Lisa, family

The next morning, Bart and Leon wake Lisa by performing the song they wrote together - "Happy Birthday Lisa."

The heartfelt song expresses Bart's love for his sister and his regret for forgetting her special day.

Lisa is deeply moved by the gesture. She declares it "the best present I ever got!" and forgives Bart completely.

**Production Note:** Michael Jackson co-wrote this song. However, due to contractual obligations with his record label, Jackson's singing voice was performed by a soundalike, Kipp Lennon.

#### Scene 15: Leon's True Identity
**Location:** Simpson Home
**Characters:** Leon, Homer, Bart, Lisa, Marge

After the emotional moment, Leon speaks - but now with a completely different voice. He speaks with an Italian-American accent.

He reveals his true identity: his name is Leon Kompowsky, and he's a bricklayer from Paterson, New Jersey.

Leon explains that he was once an angry, unhappy man. But when he started speaking like Michael Jackson and believing he was the pop star, people responded to him with love and kindness. The persona brought him happiness and peace.

Now that he's helped Bart and Lisa, Leon feels ready to face the world as himself again.

Leon departs, leaving the Simpson family with a newfound appreciation for each other.
