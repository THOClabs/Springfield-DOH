## Synopsis

A new troublemaker named Donny arrives at Springfield Elementary School, and Bart is thrilled to finally meet someone who matches his pranking prowess. The two quickly become partners in mischief, pulling off elaborate pranks around the school. However, unbeknownst to Bart, Donny is actually a plant recruited by Principal Skinner and Superintendent Chalmers from a Shelbyville orphanage. His mission: infiltrate Bart's inner circle and expose his pranking operation. Donny proves to be an excellent mole, taking the fall for Bart's pranks while feeding intelligence to Skinner, keeping the principal one step ahead of Bart's schemes. When Groundskeeper Willie tips off Bart that there's a rat among his friends, Bart wrongly suspects his best friend Milhouse instead of Donny. The truth eventually comes out when Bart and Donny are caught by Skinner, Chalmers, and Willie - who reveals himself as yet another informant. However, Donny's conscience gets the better of him. Feeling guilty about betraying the only person who ever truly befriended him, Donny helps Bart escape by setting off a Diet Coke and Mentos explosion. The two part ways on the school rooftop, promising to remain friends despite everything. Meanwhile, in a parallel subplot, Marge rear-ends Hans Moleman's car, and while their vehicle is in the shop, Homer receives a luxury loaner car. He becomes deeply attached to the upscale vehicle, treating it like a beloved family member, much to Marge's chagrin. The episode concludes with Ralph Wiggum pointing out a rat scurrying across a fence, cheerfully announcing "The rat symbolizes obviousness!" - a direct jab at the heavy-handed symbolism in the film The Departed.
