## Synopsis

Santa's Little Helper has been acting up, misbehaving around the house. The family discovers he's been romancing a female greyhound named She's the Fastest, who gives birth to 25 puppies. The Simpsons are overwhelmed by the litter, and when Mr. Burns sees the puppies, he offers to adopt them all—but his true intention is to make them into a fur coat. In a parody of Disney's "101 Dalmatians," Burns sings about his evil plan in the showstopper number "See My Vest." Bart and Lisa must rescue the puppies before Burns can skin them, ultimately saving all 25 dogs.

Made from real gorilla chest!
Feel this sweater, there's no better
Than authentic Irish setter!
See this hat, 'twas my cat,
My evening wear, vampire bat!
These white slippers are albino
African endangered rhino!
Grizzly bear underwear,
Turtle's necks I've got my share!
Beret of poodle, on my noodle

Try my red robin suit,
