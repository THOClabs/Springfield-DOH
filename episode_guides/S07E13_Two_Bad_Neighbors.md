## Synopsis

Former President George H.W. Bush and his wife Barbara move into the house across the street from the Simpsons, seeking respite from politics in Springfield - the city with the lowest voter turnout in America. While George bonds with Ned Flanders and Barbara gets along with the Simpson children, Bart's pranks and irreverent attitude quickly get on George's nerves. After Bart accidentally shreds George's memoirs with an outboard motor, Bush gives Bart a spanking. This enrages Homer, sparking an escalating feud between the two neighbors that includes bottle rocket attacks, vandalism, and culminates in a sewer brawl. After Barbara pressures George to apologize, the Bushes sell their house and leave Springfield. The house is immediately purchased by former President Gerald Ford, who befriends Homer with promises of watching football, nachos, and beer.

## Production Notes

### Episode Development
- Bill Oakley conceived the idea two years before production
- Inspired by the real feud between the Bush family and The Simpsons
- Ken Keeler assigned to write when Oakley and Weinstein became showrunners
- Writers deliberately made it a "personal attack" rather than political satire
- Oakley stressed: "it's not a political attack, it's a personal attack"
- Episode pokes fun at Bush's "crotchetiness" rather than his policies

### Real-Life Background
- Barbara Bush called The Simpsons "the dumbest thing I've ever seen" (People Magazine, October 1, 1990)
- Writers sent an angry response letter written in character as Marge Simpson
- Barbara Bush later apologized
- President Bush (Jan 27, 1992): "We are going to keep on trying to strengthen the American family, to make American families a lot more like the Waltons and a lot less like the Simpsons"

### Voice Casting
- Harry Shearer voiced George H.W. Bush (despite hype about the "appearance")
- Tress MacNeille voiced Barbara Bush
- Dan Castellaneta voiced Gerald Ford
- No actual politicians provided their own voices

### Gerald Ford Ending
- Originally, Richard Nixon was going to move in at the end
- Changed to Bob Dole following Nixon's death (April 22, 1994)
- Writers ultimately chose Gerald Ford as funnier and "best represented Homer"
