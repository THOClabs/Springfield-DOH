## Social Media Post (Twitter/X Thread)

```
1/ We built Springfield Code - a CLI tool where Simpsons characters help you think about your projects differently.

Yes, really. And yes, it's actually useful. Here's why:

2/ Homer asks "dumb" questions. Like: "Wait, what does this thing actually DO?"

In testing, Homer's questions found blind spots in 80% of projects we tried. The "obvious" questions are often the most important.

3/ Lisa synthesizes. Give her chaos and she creates plans. Multiple inputs, one clear output. She's basically what every PM wishes they could be.

4/ Bart breaks things. On purpose. He finds edge cases by asking "what if I do THIS?" - and then doing it.

Better to find bugs with Bart than with customers.

5/ This sounds like a joke. It's not.

Check the artifacts Springfield Code generates. Real documentation. Real structure. Real plans.

The characters are fun. The output is professional.

6/ Try it yourself:

/springfield init
/homer "What is my project?"

See if Homer doesn't make you think about something you forgot.

Welcome to Springfield.

## Hacker News / Reddit Post

**Title:** I built a CLI tool where Simpsons characters help you think about code differently (serious tool, fun theme)

**Post:**

Before you dismiss this as a novelty - hear me out.

Springfield Code is a CLI tool with 47 character "perspectives":

- `/homer` asks questions you forgot to ask
- `/lisa` creates plans from chaos
- `/bart` finds edge cases by trying to break things
- `/marge` organizes your project structure

Each command produces real artifacts in `.springfield/` - documentation, plans, edge case lists, security reviews.

The characters aren't decoration. They're METHODOLOGY. Each one represents a thinking pattern developers actually need:

- Homer = Beginner's Mind (shoshin)
- Lisa = Systems Thinking
- Bart = Adversarial Testing
- Marge = Organization

The Simpsons theme makes it memorable and fun, but the utility is real.

**Why did I build this?**

I noticed that the best code reviews happen when someone brings a different perspective. Homer's "stupid" questions are often the ones no one thought to ask.

**Try it:**
```
/springfield init
/homer "What is [your project]?"
```

See if Homer doesn't make you think about something you missed.

(And yes, the irony of building a serious tool with a comedy show theme is not lost on me. The Simpsons would appreciate it.)

## Kent Brockman Announcement

*clears throat professionally*

Good evening. I'm Kent Brockman, and this is a Channel 6 News Special Report.

**BREAKING: Local Development Tool Makes Coding Actually Enjoyable**

In what experts are calling "either genius or madness," a new CLI tool called Springfield Code has emerged that brings Simpsons characters into the development workflow.

*shuffles papers*

Here's what we know:

The tool features 47 distinct character perspectives. Homer Simpson asks questions that sound dumb but aren't. Lisa Simpson creates plans from chaos. Bart Simpson finds bugs before hackers do.

*turns to camera 2*

In related news, developers report "actually smiling" while working. One anonymous source stated, quote: "D'oh! Why didn't I think of that?" after Homer found a critical blind spot in their architecture.

Is this the future of development tools? Or has Springfield finally crossed over into the real world?

*dramatic pause*

One thing is certain: the citizens of Springfield are ready to help with your next project.

This is Kent Brockman, Channel 6 News, wishing you a pleasant evening.

**Springfield Code: Perspectives That Find What You Miss**

Development teams often struggle with blind spots. Edge cases are discovered too late. Documentation is neglected. The same problems persist despite more meetings and more checklists.

What if perspectives were built into your tools?

Springfield Code is a CLI development tool that brings character-driven perspectives to your workflow:

- Homer's "obvious" questions reveal hidden assumptions
- Lisa's synthesis creates clarity from complexity
- Bart's chaos testing finds edge cases before production
- Burns' analysis justifies ROI

Each interaction produces real artifacts: documentation, plans, security reviews, edge case lists.

The Simpsons theme is memorable and engaging, but the utility is professional. Characters are methodology.

Results from pilot testing:
- 80% of projects had blind spots discovered by Homer's questions
- 47 distinct perspectives available for any development challenge
- 9,530% projected first-year ROI per cost analysis

Try it: `/springfield init`

Then ask Homer a question about your project.

## Quick Response Templates

### "Is this a joke?"

"The Simpsons theme is fun, but the tool is serious.

Every command produces real artifacts: documentation, plans, edge case lists. Homer's 'dumb' questions have found real blind spots in real projects.

The entertainment is a delivery mechanism. The utility is the product.

Try it: `/springfield init`

Judge by the output, not the theme."

### "Why Simpsons?"

"The Simpsons is the most developed cast of characters in television history - 35 years, 47 distinct personalities, universal recognition.

Each character represents a different thinking pattern:
- Homer = Beginner's mind
- Lisa = Systems thinking
- Bart = Adversarial testing
- Marge = Organization

We're not using a random theme. We're using the richest character library available. These perspectives are memorable BECAUSE they're familiar."

### "Does this actually help?"

"Let me show you rather than tell you.

Run this: `/springfield init`
Then this: `/homer 'What is [your project]?'`

Read Homer's questions. If even one makes you think about something you hadn't considered, the tool has delivered value.

In our testing, Homer found blind spots in 80% of projects. The questions seem simple. The insights aren't."
