# Homer's Questions

*scratches head* D'oh! Let me think about this...

---

## About Those "CRITICAL" Things Marge Found

### 1. The NaN Validation Thing
**Question:** Why can't we just... let numbers be numbers? What's the worst that could happen if someone types "abc" instead of "30000" for a timeout?

*thinks harder*

Oh wait... if the timeout becomes NaN, does that mean it waits forever? Or zero seconds? Either way sounds bad. Like when I set the microwave to "potato" instead of a time.

**Follow-up:** What SHOULD happen when someone gives us garbage? Explode? Use a default? Send them to bed without dinner?

---

### 2. Config Validation Not Called
**Question:** We HAVE a function that checks if the config is good... but we never USE it?

*confused Homer noises*

That's like having a smoke detector but never putting batteries in it! Who decided to write a safety check and then... not check?

**Follow-up:** Where SHOULD we call this `validateConfig()` thing? At startup? Every time someone asks for config? When?

---

### 3. Silent Skill Registration
**Question:** So skills can FAIL to load and nobody knows?

*stares blankly*

That's like ordering a beer and Moe just... doesn't give you one. And doesn't tell you. You just sit there. Forever. Wondering.

**Follow-up:** What skills are even loading? How do I know if MY skill loaded? Is there a list somewhere?

---

### 4. Silent Config Parse Failure
**Question:** If my JSON config file is broken, it just... uses defaults? Without telling me?

*counts on fingers*

So I could have a typo in my config file, think I'm using MY settings, but actually be using the DEFAULT settings, and never know until something goes wrong at 3am?

**Homer's Wisdom:** That's not a feature, that's a TRAP.

---

### 5. Silent Agent Load Failure
**Question:** Characters can fail to load and use "fallback dialogue"? What's fallback dialogue?

*worried*

What if I try to summon myself and I'm not there? Do I get a FAKE Homer? Does fake Homer like donuts? WHAT IF HE DOESN'T?

**Follow-up:** How do we know when we're talking to the real character vs a fallback?

---

## About The HIGH Priority Stuff

### 6. Tool Name Bypass
**Question:** Marge says something about underscores bypassing security. So `ralph_loop` is different from `ralph-loop`?

*tries to understand*

Why would the computer think those are different? They're both Ralph! It's like saying Homer_Simpson can get into Moe's but Homer-Simpson can't!

---

### 7. Stats Save Failure
**Question:** User stats can fail to save and we just... lose them?

*drops donut in shock*

MY STATS! My beautiful stats! All that progress... gone? Like tears in rain? Like donuts in my belly?

---

### 8. Version Mismatch
**Question:** The code says version 3.0.2 but package.json says 3.0.3. Which one is lying?

*suspicious look*

In this house we do NOT tolerate liars. One of these numbers has to go.

---

### 9. CLAUDE.md Is Wrong
**Question:** The documentation describes OLD code that doesn't exist anymore?

That's like if the Kwik-E-Mart menu still showed "Squishees: 50 cents" but they actually cost $5 now. FRAUD!

---

## Homer's Summary

*finishes donut*

Look, I don't understand half of what Marge wrote. But I DO understand this:

1. **Things are failing silently** - That's sneaky. I don't like sneaky.
2. **Safety checks exist but aren't used** - That's lazy. Wait, I respect lazy. But not THIS lazy.
3. **Numbers lie** - Version numbers, NaN numbers, all liars.
4. **Documentation is fiction** - If the manual is wrong, how do I know ANYTHING?

The real question is: **Why did we build a house with smoke detectors that have no batteries?**

*wanders off looking for more donuts*

D'oh!
