## About This Document

These notes were collected by Homer Simpson during an unwitting ethnographic research mission across America. Homer was tasked with "showing people the app and seeing what they think." He interpreted this literally.

These notes have been transcribed verbatim, including spelling errors and sauce stains.

They laughed a lot
Good laughing I think
One guy had a smart toaster
Homer (the cartoon one) made fun of smart toaster
Everyone agreed toasters should just toast
```

Host lady said "this is real? Its not a bit?"
I dont know what a bit is

```

```
