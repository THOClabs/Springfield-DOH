# Maggie's Observations

*The Silent Data: Emotional Intelligence from the Youngest Observer*

---

## About This Document

Maggie Simpson, age 1, accompanied Homer on his cross-country journey. Unknown to Homer, Lisa had prepared Maggie with a custom observation journal featuring icons to circle:

- **Donut**: Dad had an insight
- **Lightning Bolt**: User got excited
- **Question Mark**: Someone was confused
- **Heart**: Emotional connection occurred
- **Star**: Special/notable moment

Maggie cannot write, but she observes. And she understands far more than anyone realizes.
