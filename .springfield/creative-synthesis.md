## KRUSTY'S PREVIEW: What the Enhanced Experience Looks Like

*honks horn*

Hey hey! Let me show you what this all looks like when it comes together!

### Preview 1: First-Time User Experience

```
$ npx springfield-code init

*The screen flickers to life*

TROY McCLURE:
  Hi! I'm Troy McClure! You may remember me from such
  CLI tools as "Git But Fun" and "Your First Commit."

  Welcome to Springfield Code!

  *files appear*

  I just created your .springfield/ directory with:
  ├── project.md     ← Define your vision
  ├── task.md        ← Track your work
  ├── completion.md  ← Know when you're done
  └── iterations.md  ← Prevent scope creep

  Ready to meet the citizens of Springfield?
  Try: /homer "What is [your project]?"

  They're waiting to help. And I promise, they're
  more useful than they look.

  *winks*
```

### Preview 2: Homer's Enhanced Voice

```
$ /homer "What are we building?"

*scratches head*

Okay, so... let me make sure I understand this.

*picks up coffee mug*

You're building a thing. The thing does... things.

*sets down mug*

Here's what I'm confused about:

1. If I were using this thing, what would I DO with it?
   Like, what's the first thing I'd click? Or type?

2. Who's going to be mad if this thing breaks?
   That's usually a good way to figure out what's important.

3. *sudden insight* Wait - can this thing work WITHOUT internet?
   Because you KNOW that's gonna come up.

4. Is there a way to undo stuff? Because I break things a lot.
   And I've learned that undo buttons are... important.

*takes sip of coffee*

Sorry if these are dumb questions. Marge says they're
usually the ones nobody thinks to ask.
```

### Preview 3: Lisa's Synthesis with Delight

```
$ /lisa

*adjusts saxophone*

Let me look at what we have across all our documents...

*plays thoughtful note*

SYNTHESIS COMPLETE

I see three distinct themes emerging:

1. TECHNICAL DEBT - 9 issues to fix (5 critical, 4 high)
   → Validated prototypes ready (experiments.md)
   → 60+ test cases prepared (tests.md)
   → ROI: 9,530% (budget.md)

2. EXPERIENCE GAP - User journey undefined
   → Onboarding flow needed (experience-journey.md)
   → Voice consistency needed (voice-guide.md)
   → Delight moments ready (delight-moments.md)

3. IDENTITY CLARITY - Who are we?
   → Core philosophy defined (vision.md)
   → Messaging ready (messaging.md)
   → 30 documents of depth

*plays ascending scale*

The technical work enables the experience work.
The experience work expresses the identity.
Everything connects.

[🎷 Achievement Unlocked: Full Synthesis]
You've seen the complete picture. Only 3% of users get here.
```

### Preview 4: Milestone Celebration

```
[After completing first full episode]

*ALL CHARACTERS APPEAR*

KRUSTY: Hey hey! A full ensemble episode!
BURNS: Excellent. The team investment has paid off.
HOMER: *excited* Did I help? I feel like I helped!
LISA: You did, Dad. We all did.
MARGE: *satisfied sigh* Everything is organized now.
BART: And I broke, like, a LOT of stuff on purpose!
NELSON: Ha-ha! You found seventeen edge cases!

*confetti*

LISA: Seriously though - you just ran a comprehensive
      planning session with 12+ perspectives. That's...
      not nothing.

      .springfield/ now contains 23 documents.
      You're ready for implementation.

      Whenever you need us, we're here.

      *plays warm saxophone note*

      Welcome to Springfield.
